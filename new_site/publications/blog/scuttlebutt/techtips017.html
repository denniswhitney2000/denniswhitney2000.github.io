            <p>Few of us ever pay much attention to things that are inherently<br>safe, right? We have a tendency to use infamous phrases like<br>“What could possibly go wrong”. Lulled by endless years of<br>faithful service we have a tendency to ignore, or take for granted,<br>parts of our boats that never seem to cause problems. Yes, we<br>give them cursory inspections from time to time, but do we really<br>know what we are looking at, and do we understand the applica-<br>tion in which it’s used?<br><br>How about something as reliable as a hose? Lately I’ve<br>been exposed to several situations where something as simple as<br>a hose, was used in such a way that it was a set-up for disaster.<br>One of the first things we have to understand is that hoses have a<br>life span. They don’t last forever. Most manufacturers recom-<br>mend that marine hoses be replaced every ten years, whether<br>they look worn out or not. Environmental factors; heat, cold,<br>exposure to oils, gasses, and other chemicals will gradually<br>break down the rubber and other materials used to construct the<br>hose and it will eventually fail. Even following a good routine of<br>inspections you may not be able to detect the imminent failure of<br>a hose. The outside may look fine, no cracks, chafe, drips or<br>other damage. But what does the inside look like? Has an over-<br>tightened clamp crushed the inner lining of the hose so that it’s<br>really only the outer covering that’s holding back the ocean? Has<br>corrosion of the reinforcing wire on your raw water intake hose<br>advanced to the point where it could collapse under the suction<br>of the raw water pump and starve the water flow that cools the<br>engine and its exhaust? I have to admit that a few of the hoses on<br>my 30+ year old boat have exceeded that 10 year replacement<br>recommendation from time to time but since rebuilding the<br>engine the oldest hose is now the garden hose I use to fill the<br>potable water tank.<br><br>Another important thing about hoses is how we connect<br>them to the systems on our boats. I’m a firm believer in using<br>proper hose barb fittings and double hose clamps for all under<br>water applications. Slipping a hose over a smooth surfaced pipe<br>doesn’t give the hose anything to “grab” no matter how much<br>you tighten the clamps. Although threaded pipe gives you<br>something to grab, tightening the clamps against sharp threads<br>results in cutting the interior surface and setting the stage for<br>further deterioration. A properly sized barbed fitting and a hose<br>clamped with moderate torque will last for the life of the hose<br>and is able to withstand considerably more pressure than any<br>other form of attachment, with the possible exception of a<br>swaged fitting which would be totally impractical for this appli-<br>cation.<br><br>Bill Lundquist recently identified several of these “what<br>not to do” situations while upgrading many of the systems on his<br>Petrel. When inspecting one of his deck scupper drain through<br>hulls below the waterline, Bill could see rubber, and could stick<br>his finger in and feel rubber hose. What was holding it on the<br>through hull? Where was the through hull? A quick look at the<br>inside of the hull showed a scupper hose going through the<br>ceiling and disappearing into the unknown. Upon removal of the<br>woodwork he could see that there were some significant<br>problems with this installation. There was no through hull! The<br>hose was just fiberglassed to the hull. This was a 30+ year old<br>boat. When do you think the 30+ year old hose was last<br>replaced?<br><br>Although these problems were identified on a fiberglass<br>boat similar issues can be found on many wooden boats. The<br>hose has never leaked, why fix it? I like to ask the question<br>differently: ‘how confident are you when the weather kicks up<br><br>and it’s a long way to shore?’<br></p>
