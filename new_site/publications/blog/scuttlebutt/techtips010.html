            <p>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical<br>experience accumulated by our membership and not just my<br>favorite boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place<br>where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either<br>obtain direct answers in this column or direction to appropriate<br>reference material.<br><br>With this article we'll return to the originally scripted plan and<br>look at the instrumentation (depth, speed, GPS, LORAN, etc.)<br>most of us have, at least to some minimum degree, aboard the<br>boat. In a previous article we looked at the marine compass,<br>possibly the best, most reliable instrument you could hope to<br>find. Of course it doesn't require things that fail like external<br>power, remote sensors, or interface cables, so it’s bound to be<br>reliable. Almost all of the other instruments on our boats today<br>are electronic. That's not to say they are unreliable, but because<br>they need a power source, they can become inoperative at the<br>most inopportune time. So before I go any further, a word of<br>warning. Never, ever, ever, ever rely solely on electronic instru-<br>ments as your only reference when navigating. Electronic instru-<br>ments are great tools, but like a good hammer, it is only as good<br>as the skilled hand that uses it.<br><br>Paper charts are basic reference around which all of our other<br>navigation instruments revolve. Before you go cruising have<br>good charts with you, and make sure they are up to date. Just<br>because you have this year's edition doesn't guarantee they have<br>all the latest changes incorporated into them. Even if you have<br>the latest electronic charting software it will most likely be out of<br>date. If you have an Internet connection go to the First Coast<br>Guard District website http://www.uscg.mil/d1/navinfo.htm and<br>download the latest monthly Local Notice to Mariners, or if you<br>don't have a computer, subscribe and have it sent by mail. Many<br>local libraries also have computer work stations that can be used<br>to download the information you select. The monthly edition has<br>information concerning the waterways of the First Coast Guard<br>District, which covers the coastal waters from Eastport, Maine to<br>Shrewsbury, New Jersey.<br><br>The website is a superior source of information. Not only is<br>there a link to the Local Notices but as you can see from the<br>table below, a source for many of the other publications you<br>should have onboard including Volume | of the Light List and<br>the Ist District Coast Pilot. Another good feature of the site is<br>that as a taxpayer you already paid for the information, the<br>download is free. Printing could be a different story. You're on<br><br>our own for that!<br><br>National Imagery & Mapping Local Notice to<br>Agency (NIMA) Mariners<br>Chart Corrections - First District | Light List - Vol 1<br>Charts (PDF)<br>Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Coast Pilot<br>Private Aids to Navigation Links |<br>L Special Notice to Mariners Contact Us<br><br>While you are in the site you need to look at the latest Weekly<br>Supplement to the Local Notice to Mariners (LNM). The weekly<br>LNM contains all the new changes and other late breaking<br>updates since publication of the monthly LNM. If you've never<br>looked at this web site, or seen these two documents, you really<br>need to. I know that they look intimidating to someone who has<br>not seen them before, but once you get used to how they are<br>organized, and the information they contain, they can literally be<br>lifesavers if you heed the information in them.<br><br>As recreational sailors we don't always pay that much attention<br>to updating our charts. That's not good. Whether you are a<br>‘compass and clock navigator’, or have the slickest new electron-<br>ics, your charts still need to have the right information on them.<br>Searching for a buoy or mark in the fog (we have had a lot of<br>practice doing that these last three years!) whether based on a<br>DR, Loran or GPS, can be real frustrating or down right scary if<br>the buoy has been moved or replaced by a temporary buoy and<br>you didn't know it because your charts are out of date. As an<br>example, if you sail Frenchman or Blue Hill Bay and go looking<br>for the Egg Rock, Bell buoy 8 (44-11-01.88N, 068-30-34.19W),<br>it's not there any more.<br><br>Some of the other information in the Monthly Edition are<br>special warnings for various harbors, including Boston, Ports-<br>mouth NH, and Kennebunkport. These harbors now have<br>specials security zones in force. The Monthly Edition references<br>the charts and other information sources so that you can stay out<br>of trouble while trying to enjoy a cruise. Additionally it has<br>information on the bridge repairs on SR27 Bridge across the<br>Townsend Gut and the new operating schedule necessitated by<br>the repairs. Depending on your summer plans, this could be very<br>worthwhile information.<br><br>The Weekly Supplement # 19/05 has updated information for<br>chart 13283, Cape Neddick Harbor to Isles of Shoals. It corrects<br>the VAR data to 2005 values and changes the annual decrease<br>for several compass roses on the chart. I don't know about you<br>but I like to have this type of information.<br><br>The nautical chart is the basis of navigation on the water. No<br>matter how basic or advanced your instrumentation is you need<br>accurate charts. Be prepared. Take a look at the Monthly and<br>Weekly Local Notice to Mariners and update your charts before<br><br>you get underway.<br><br>Racing Numbers<br>The Race Committee is asking skippers to use sloop numbers for<br>racing. Numbers do not have to be permanently attached to sails,<br>they can be attached to shrouds. Numbers should be large<br>enough to be read from a reasonable distance.<br><br></p>
