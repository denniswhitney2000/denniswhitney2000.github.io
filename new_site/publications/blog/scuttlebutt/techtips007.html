            <p>Tech Tips<br><br>by Bill Whitney<br><br>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical<br>experience accumulated by our membership and not just my<br>favorite boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place<br>where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either<br>obtain direct answers in this column or direction to appropriate<br>reference material.<br><br>Since you have not asked for specifics since the last newslet-<br>ter, I'm suspicious that you may not know how to contact me.<br>You can contact me via e-mail at wmcwhitney@earthlink net,<br>or better yet, see me at one of the FSS meetings.<br><br>Just to refresh your memory the planned topics for this<br>column were; electrical wiring, alternators and regulators,<br>batteries, grounding and bonding, radios and antennas, and<br>instrumentation (navigation aids, depth, speed, GPS, LORAN,<br>etc.). We have already covered wiring, alternators and regula-<br>tors, batteries, bonding and grounding, radios and antennas; so<br>let's talk about instruments and instrumentation. This is a big<br>topic, so it will probably be divided into two or more<br>installments.<br><br>To begin with, let's start with a statement: "All instruments<br>are subject to errors and/or misinterpretations." A warning: "If<br>you don't know how to use an instrument, or understand its'<br>limitations, you are better off without it." And some advise:<br>“Caution and commonsense when using quality instruments<br>will usually yield good information." But enough of this,<br>hopefully you'll get my point as we look at instrumentation<br>systems more closely.<br><br>The basic “instrument " aboard all vessels is the marine<br>compass. Its' a truly remarkable, reliable piece of gear once it is<br>properly adjusted for the boat that surrounds it. Since there are<br>numerous good books on compasses and their use, including the<br>venerable "Chapman's", there is no necessity to explain how<br>this simple instrument works. But its simplicity can also be its<br>weakness if you don't understand magnetism. If you have<br>moved any major ferromagnetic (i.e. iron, steel, etc.) compo-<br>nents on the boat since the last time the compass was checked<br>you may have a problem and not know it. Likewise, if you have<br>moved any electrical wiring or changed the current flow in<br>wires close to the compass, you could also have a problem.<br>Even the storage of your toolbox or placement your favorite<br>binoculars too close to the compass could significantly alter<br>your port of arrival.<br><br>You should check your compass at least annually, preferably<br>after all your gear is in its normal stored location. There are<br>several ways to do it. I usually consult the almanac (or<br>Eldridge) and use the sun's azimuth at sunrise but another<br>simple way is to use a fixed range on a calm day. You can also<br>use your LORAN or GPS, but remember to pick a position that<br>is at least 10 miles away from your current position. You also<br>need to make sure you have programmed the readout for a<br>magnetic heading. If you have set up the GPS or LORAN for a<br>true heading verify that you have set the variation correctly. If<br>the compass heading has changed more than 2 or 3 degrees you<br><br>should have the compass / vessel system checked by a<br>professional compass adjuster. The main point here is to check<br>your compass at least annually.<br><br>Another group of instruments that we tend to ignore are those<br>that monitor the engine functions. 99% of the time we take<br>these instruments totally for granted, until something suddenly<br>doesn't seem right and you really need know what is going<br>wrong. Now you're really aware of the gauges. But are they<br>right?......Do they even work? Have you ever checked them?<br>For most of us the honest answer is no, we never have. We<br>always took their readings at face value and never questioned<br>their accuracy.<br><br>From a practical standpoint, you don't really have to calibrate<br>these instruments, but you do need to check their operation<br>before starting the engine and during the warm-up process. You<br>also need to know what the "right" reading should be. Do you?<br>Electrical gauges have the unique characteristic of having both<br>a mechanical zero and an electrical zero. This property makes<br>them easy to check for basic operation. Before you turn<br>anything on (like the ignition key), look at where the needle<br>rests. This is the mechanical zero. When you first apply power<br>to gauge, but before you start cranking the engine, the needle<br>will move (sometimes jump) to the electrical zero position.<br>When you see this movement it indicates that the winding<br>inside the meter movement are good and the bearings that<br>support the needle are OK. If you don't ...... well something<br>could be wrong. (Or, in the case of a temperature gauge, you<br>may have an older style mechanical gauge that does not have an<br>electrical meter movement.) An electrical meter movement<br>should move freely.<br><br>The actual value that it reads is less important as long as you<br>know what it displays when the engine is warmed up and<br>operating normally. In fact many modern meters don't even<br>display a numerical value, just an approximate value. The word<br>"Hot" doesn't really tell you much, except that this relative<br>value is above the "Normal" range of the engine. But again, the<br>main point here is not the technical complexity of the engine<br>gauges. Its that they have to work, and that you really need to<br>know what a "normal" reading is BEFORE the information<br>supplied by the gauge becomes critical.<br><br>As with the compass, these instruments need to be checked<br>for proper operation. My recommendation is that you take a<br>serious look at them every time you run the engine. This way<br>you know what the normal reading is and you will be aware of<br>anything that is changing over time, like a heat exchanger that<br>is slowly becoming less effective, or an alternator that isn't<br>recharging the batteries.<br><br>In the next article we will get into the navigation instruments<br>and the things to be aware of when approaching that unfamiliar<br>harbor in the dark on a rainy night.<br></p>
