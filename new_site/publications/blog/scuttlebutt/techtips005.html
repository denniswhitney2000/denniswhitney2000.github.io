            <p>Tech Tips #5<br><br>by “The Old Salt” (Bill Whitney)<br><br>Goodness! It’s already June! Where did the time go? Here<br>I am, sitting in the workshop, surrounded by boat projects,<br>hoping I can get them all done before the end of the month. All<br>the paint, varnish, terminal strips, wire, and other parapherna-<br>lia that keeps the discount chandleries in business seem to reach<br>a peak in June before it gets to the boat. Hope I get it all done<br>by the end of the month. One of the projects that I have<br>managed to complete is to install a separate ground for the AC<br>wiring system. It’s also time to look at all of the seacocks and<br>see if there are any signs of galvanic corrosion. Strangely<br>enough, those were two of the topics that were on the original<br>list of articles I was planning to write. In case you don’t<br>remember, the topics are; electrical wiring, alternators and<br>regulators, batteries, grounding and bonding, radios and anten-<br>nas, and instrumentation (depth, speed, GPS, LORAN, etc.). In<br>this article we'll look at electrical system grounding and how it<br>can impact your boat if you don’t pay a little attention to your<br>ground connections now and then.<br><br>Once again, I would like to solicit questions from readers.<br>After all, this column is intended to be the place where you, the<br>reader, can submit technical questions and either obtain<br>answers or direction to appropriate reference material.<br><br>The DC System components in a boat are usually the easiest<br>to understand. We have already presented its components:<br>battery(ies), alternator, regulator, and wiring in previous<br>articles. In general terms the battery produces the electrical<br>energy that you need, the alternator replenishes the energy you<br>consumed, and the regulator tells the alternator how much<br>energy to replenish. The wiring delivers the energy to the<br>system components. In a DC system the negative (-) side of the<br>battery is normally connected directly to the engine block. The<br>primary reason for this is that the starter motor usually has the<br>highest current draw of all the other electrical components in<br>the system; and running the negative side of the wiring directly<br>to the engine block near the starter is good design practice, as it<br>keeps any voltage drop in the wiring to a minimum.<br><br>At the same time it also creates a problem; especially if you<br>have both DC and AC electrical systems. General practice is to<br>connect the green wire of the three-wire AC system to a<br>grounded point on the boat. That point is normally a terminal<br>Strip that is also used for the black wires of the DC system; and<br>that’s connected back to the engine block. Well, under normal<br>conditions, when you are out sailing or hanging on the<br>mooring, the common connection of both DC and AC grounds<br>does not have any adverse effects. But if you have a slip in a<br>marina, and plug in the AC system for any sustained length of<br>time, you could be creating a condition that not only eats up<br>your engine cooling system zincs (you do know where they are<br>located, don’t you?) but also sets up a condition that can devas-<br>tate underwater boat fittings.<br><br>So, what’s going on! The problem stems from the electrical<br>system at the marina and the other vessels plugged into the<br>system. The problem is transmitted to your boat and any other<br>boat plugged into the system through the green ground wire of<br>the AC wiring system that you so conveniently connected to the<br>ocean in and around your boat via that common ground connec-<br>tion - your engine.<br><br>Under ideal conditions, as long as the marina wiring is<br>installed according to the National Electrical Code (NEC), and<br>no other boats are plugged in, you have little to worry about.<br>Problems arise when the marina’s electrical system corrodes or<br>connections loosen with age. As the AC current in the less than<br>ideal wiring system increases, voltages can be induced in the<br>ground wire that create a small current through the ground<br>connection to your engine. Another cause can be other boats<br>that are plugged into the AC system. If they have an electrical<br>problem, and the same common ground connection, you have a<br>problem. Any stray ground currents created in the marina’s<br>wiring or galvanic corrosion problems created on other boats<br>can be coupled to your boat through that green ground wire.<br><br>If you have noticed that your engine zincs seem to waste away<br>over the course of one season, you may have a problem. The<br>best way to avoid the problem is to unplug the AC power cord<br>when you don’t need it. This way you have removed the<br>connection that was being provided by the green ground wire.<br>Another way is to isolate the ground or install an isolation<br>transformer. I don’t recommend the latter solution for our size<br>boats however, since they are both expensive and heavy. I do<br>recommend minimizing the use of the AC shore power cord,<br>and keeping your DC system as clean and healthy as you can.<br><br>One of the other symptoms of this AC ground current<br>problem can also be accelerated deterioration of other underwa-<br>ter components of the boat. In wooden boats this can include<br>the screws, boat nails, and other fastenings that hold everything<br>together. Unfortunately many of these may not be visible, so<br>you can’t inspect them. You can, and should, look at all the<br>other fittings. These include the zincs, seacocks, valves,<br>stemhead fittings, rudder fittings, straps and engine accessories<br>that are exposed to saltwater. Any heat exchangers on the<br>engine should have their own sacrificial zincs. If you have<br>never checked them or worse yet don’t know where they are<br>located, get out the engine manual (or see your mechanic) and<br>find them. Nothing will ruin a cruise faster than having all<br>your oil pumped out through hole in the engine oil cooler.<br>Admittedly these are sail powered vessels, but my blood<br>pressure doesn’t need the boost it gets tacking through a<br>crowded mooring field trying to get to my mooring. The<br>challenge is a lot more fun knowing that you have a reliable<br>engine to extract you from disaster should anything go wrong.<br><br>(Continued to Page 7)<br>Inspect the valves (and other bronze components) by taking<br>them apart and looking at the interior and exterior surfaces. If<br>you see a pinkish tinge on the bronze surfaces it indicates that<br>the zinc is being leached out of the bronze. You need to inves-<br>tigate! Either you have an AC problem or you need to add more<br>sacrificial zincs to protect the components from galvanic corro-<br>sion. Selecting the right amount of zinc to a hull and selecting<br>the appropriate location for it is not that easy. If you know<br>what was used on your boat in the past, and know where it was<br>located on the hull, restore it to that original location and use<br>the same size that was used originally. You can cause yourself<br>problems if you use too much zinc.<br><br>Master Mariner Co. used to manufacture a corrosion meter<br>that was very useful in determining the level of protection being<br>provided to underwater metallic fittings. Basically it is a very<br>sensitive meter, called a galvanometer, that is hooked between a<br>reference cell that is placed in the water beside the boat and the<br>metal fitting being tested. If the meter indicated a balanced<br>reading in mid-scale it indicated that the fitting was not being<br>subjected to galvanic currents that would either eat it away or<br>deposit metal from another fitting on it. In effect it was in a<br>neutral, protected, environment. If you can locate one of these<br>meters or its modern replacement I think it is worthwhile to<br>spend some time measuring each fitting, and either adding (or<br>reducing) your zincs to get the protection your fittings need.<br><br>There are folks around that specialize in marine corrosion<br>problems, but I don’t know any of them personally. Your yard<br>or surveyor should be able to recommend someone if you don’t<br>want to tackle the job yourself. Good luck.<br></p>
