            <p>Tech Tips: Passenger On-Board Safety<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>The summer activities at Homecoming in Rockland are some of the Society’s cornerstone events.<br>Gathering with our friends, racing, cruising, watching the kids, swapping yarns about our nautical triumphs (“sea<br>stories” to those who don’t know us, and “bald-faced lies” to those who do!). The activities in and around Rockland<br>do a lot to bring us together and introduce the public to the Friendship Sloop Society. Talking with people on the<br>floats and taking them for a sail during the races is a great way to have fun and show folks what Friendship sloops<br>are and how they operate.<br><br>I’m not sure who came up with the idea of having the “crew call” after the skipper’s meeting, but it is a<br>fantastic way to meet new people. The people who answer the call come with a wide range of boating and sailing<br>experience; from knowing little or nothing about boats, to being very experienced. Some are former Friendship<br>owners, or people who have been sailing for years on other types of boats. But the bottom line is that anyone we<br>have invited aboard doesn’t know our specific boat, even other Friendship owners.<br><br>So, if we invite people to get underway with us, what is our responsibility? Maybe a better way to look at<br>this is to rephrase the question and ask what our liability? Basically, as the operator or captain of a documented or<br>undocumented vessel, we are liable for anything that happens on board, either at the pier or underway. Think about<br>it! That’s a big burden. We really should have some way to protect our volunteer passengers and ourselves.<br><br>One way to help ensure the safety of our passengers is to provide them with the information they need to protect<br><br>themselves and the other people who may be aboard. It all starts with a safety brief. For instance where are the life<br><br>jackets? What should I do if someone falls overboard? What if I fall overboard? Here is a representative briefing<br>similar to the one I give the new crew, even those who have sailed with me previously.<br><br>1. Introduce them to yourself and the boat. Show them where to stow their gear and how to secure it so it doesn’t<br>fly about during maneuvers or when crossing the ferry’s wake.<br><br>2. Explain how the marine head works and how not to plug it up! You can also offer them the adventure of using<br>the ships bucket. I find that to be a good way to encourage people to use facilities ashore before departing.<br><br>3. Now ask if any of your passengers are non-swimmers or poor swimmers. If you have any it’s a good time to<br>show everyone where the life jackets are stowed, and how to put one on. Insisting that non-swimmers wear a<br>life jacket is a good idea. Children under 12 must wear them. If they refuse I regrettably invite them and their<br>parents ashore.<br><br>4. One of the greatest risks we face is a person overboard. I’ve had two incidents where over-exuberant neophytes<br>nearly ended up in the drink! Now I appoint responsibilities to the crew in the case of a person-overboard event<br>and brief everyone on sounding the alarm and getting one of the cockpit cushions or any type IV flotation device<br>to the person in the water.<br><br>A. One person is assigned as the MOB spotter, and another as the alternate<br>B. Depending on crew skill, another person is assigned to sail handling<br><br>C. One person is assigned to break out the retrieval gear<br><br>D. I keep the helm and engine control responsibilities<br><br>E. Everyone else goes below (if there is anyone left!)<br><br>5. The last part of the safety brief is about on-board fires and location of fire extiguishers. Everyone has to know<br>that sounding the alarm is the first critical step in any emergency. In the case of a fire I tell everyone to go<br>forward while I try to deal with the problem.<br><br>The safety brief you provide to your crew should be what you think is appropriate. Obviously you don’t<br>want to scare anyone away, but I think we should all consider the safety of our passengers and try to give them the<br>tools they may need if things go wrong on the water.<br></p>
