            <p>Tech Tips<br><br>Written by the “Old Salt (Bill Whitney)<br><br>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical experience accumulated by our membership and not just my favorite<br>boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either obtain direct<br>answers in this column or direction to appropriate reference material. Normally at this point in the column I list the past topics and<br>transition skillfully (or not) into the next planned item. This time we’ll depart from the ordinary and discuss another practical task<br>that has nothing to do with electricity. We'll get back to navigation instruments in the next installment. (After I finish rewiring my<br>NMEA and SeaTalk networks and can relate real world problems with some first hand experience to back it up.)<br><br>I thought I'd share my latest “On-the-Job” training project with those of you who have not had the pleasure of pulling the ports out<br>of the cabin sides. Call me a maintenance fanatic but during the doldrums of winter I got this crazy idea that I had to inspect the<br>caulking and wood structure under the verdigris-covered opening ports that have been in place since we purchased the boat in 1988.<br>There were no signs of rot or other deterioration, but ....... what was lurking unseen behind all that solid looking bronze? Did I have<br>a disaster in the making? Were the ravages of rampant fungi relentlessly consuming the biodegradable parts of my boat? (Insert<br>theme music from “Pac Man”) I had to know!<br><br>Problem #1, how do you get the darn things out? Wheel puller? Big hammer? Three of your strongest friends armed with<br>crowbars? None of these alternatives seemed particularly conducive to removing the assemblies without causing considerable<br>damage so the engineer in me went to work. I found that by using some old scrap red oak and two pieces of 3/8” threaded rod and an<br>assortment of nuts and washers from the garage, I could construct something that looked a little like a primitive gear puller. One<br>piece of 1%”x 4” stock was cut to 8 3/8” which gave it about 1/16” clearance beyond the width of the outside face of the port and it<br>was rounded to match the curvature of the port opening so it would fit inside the hole cut in the cabin side through which it is<br>mounted. Two 3/8” holes are drilled 34” from each end to accept the two 3/8” x 8” threaded rods. The 3/8” rods are permanently<br>mounted to this exterior piece using two nuts and washers on each rod to firmly hold it in place.<br><br>Inside the boat there is a strong-back assembly that is made of two 1%” x 1 ’” x 8” blocks that mate to the inside of the cabin<br>sides just beyond the edge of the port assembly’s flange, and a 1 %” x 1 %” x 13” back piece. The 8” blocks are padded with scraps<br>of carpeting to protect against any damage to interior paint/varnish, and are screwed to the 13” back piece just under each end. 3/8”<br>holes are drilled in the back piece to match the picce at the outside face of the port. Figures 1 and 2 are photographs of the Port<br>Puller assembly from two perspectives.<br><br>Figure 1 shows the puller from the front, as it would be seen from outside the cabin. Figure 2 shows the puller from the top (or<br>bottom). Of course the materials can vary so it could end up looking very different from this one, but I think you get the idea. By the<br><br>way, if your ports measure 8 4” across the outside of the opening this one is for rent, cheap. I won’t need it for another fifteen years.<br><br>Figure 1 Figure 2<br><br>Getting the ports out of the cabin sides was actually fairly easy. After taking out all the bolts, (% x 20 x 1 1/2”) use a sharp knife to<br>cut the paint and varnish away from the outside of the interior and exterior flanges. This helps break any seal it may have established<br>on the assembly and should prevent any chipping or peeling of the finish as the assembly is pulled away from the cabin side. Next,<br>install the puller making sure that the puller is square in the port opening and the padded blocks are aligned just outside the edges of<br>the flange on the interior side of the port.<br><br>Gradually tighten the nuts on the threaded rods keeping the compression as equally distributed between the two rods as possible.<br>The amount of torque that you have to apply to each nut will be a function of how pliable the old caulking is. I was lucky. After some<br>tense moments of listening to the inevitable snap-crackle-pop noises that any assembly that has been undisturbed for 15 Or so years<br>will make, the port pulled smoothly out of its hole.<br>Once I got the ports out, and the bulk of the caulking<br>removed, a close inspection showed that the builder did an<br>excellent job sealing the end grain of the wood. Much to my<br>relief there was no rot to be found. All 8 cutouts were well<br>sealed with either fiberglass or epoxy resin. (Its’ hard to tell<br>which.) After I cleaned all the old caulking residue out I<br>re-coated the cutouts and bolt holes with a fresh coat of epoxy to<br>make sure they stay sealed.<br><br>Cleaning the bronze was relatively easy too. But before you<br>start make sure you have all the proper safety gear; latex dispos-<br>able gloves, safety glasses, an old apron, and plenty of clean<br>fresh water for rinsing things off. Make sure you read the safety<br>precautions on the bottle. The recipe for the cleaning solution is<br>¥, cup of muriatic acid (diluted hydrochloric acid) mixed with 2<br>to 3 gallons of water in a plastic tub. Added to this, after the<br>acid and water are well mixed, is a % cup of all-purpose<br>degreaser made by the Fuller Brush Company called "Fulsol”.<br>If you use another degreaser read the contents of the bottle<br>carefully to make sure it does not contain any chlorine type<br>bleach. '<br><br>Start by taking the port assembly completely apart so you can<br>get to all the normally inaccessible areas. Scrape any paint and<br>heavy accumulation of caulking off the bronze and place one<br>piece at a time into the tub. Try not to leave the bronze in the<br>cleaner for more than 30 minutes at a time. Use a stainless steel<br>pot scrubber to clean off the surfaces of the bronze, and flush it<br>with plenty of fresh water to stop the etching action of the acid<br>when you have it cleaned to your satisfaction. Dry the piece<br>with an old towel to remove any residue.<br><br>This is where I stop. If you want you can polish everything,<br>but why complicate your life. Brown bronze is beautiful. I don’t<br>remember where I got this tip from, but after the bronze goes<br>back to its’ oxidized state you can coat it with “Deks” no.2 to<br><br>prevent verdigris from turning everything green again.<br></p>
