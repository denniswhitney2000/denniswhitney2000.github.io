            <p>Tech Tips - The Corrosion You Never Knew You Had<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>Face it. Your boat lives in a corrosive environment.<br>Salt water, salt air, high humidity, dissimilar metals, hull sweat,<br>leaks, you name it; they all contribute one way or another to the<br>corrosion that inevitably finds its way onto your boat and mine.<br>We all recognize it in its simplest forms like rust on steel, stain-<br>less steel and iron parts or the white power, known as inter-<br>granular exfoliation, on aluminum parts. Then we have the all<br>too common green verdigris on our bronze hardware and the<br>brown patina that paves the way for it. Because these forms of<br>corrosion are readily recognized, and you can see it slowly<br>eating up your precious boat, you usually attack it and try to<br>eliminate it and its source or at least control it, which is really all<br>you can do.<br><br>Unfortunately, there are many hidden areas on a boat<br>where what we don’t see we don’t address on a routine basis.<br>When was the last time you looked at the back of your electrical<br>panel? Another common spot that is routinely forgotten is the<br>big high current electrical connections on the batteries or, more<br>importantly, the ground connection on the engine. If you<br>service the batteries annually like you should, the idea of clean-<br>ing the connections has at least crossed your mind. But you<br>may not have recognized what a little corrosion, or a poor<br>contact between the battery post and cable can create if you<br>didn’t clean the mating surfaces.<br><br>Consider for a minute the amount of DC current it<br>takes to start your engine. Depending on how cold it is and the<br>size of your power plant, it could take up to 50 Amps or more<br>from the battery to the starter motor to roll the engine over. Any<br>dirt or corrosion between the connections creates a resistance to<br>current flow. So if the connection at the battery, at the ground<br>connection on the engine, or anywhere in between is corroded,<br>less power is delivered to the starter motor. Think of this in<br>terms of water flowing in a pipe.<br><br>Where: Rate of water flow = Water pressure<br>Size of The Pipe<br><br>Electrically this equates to: Current = Voltage<br>Resistance<br><br>The rate of electrical current flow is similar to the water<br>flow. The water pressure equates to the battery’s state of<br>charge, with 13.8 Volts being a fully charged battery and the<br>size of the pipe restricting the total amount of water flow<br>through the pipe equates to resistance.<br><br>If, for example, you have a very small amount of resis-<br>tance (.5 Ohms) in the circuit, the maximum amount of current<br>delivered to the starter with a fully charged (13.8 VDC) battery<br>would be:<br><br>27.6 Amps = 13.8 Volts<br>.5 Ohms<br><br>So you can see that if you needed 50 Amps to get the<br>engine spinning over fast enough to start, that half an Ohm (.5)<br>of resistance isn’t helping. And worse still, as the resistance<br><br>=6=<br><br>goes up, the current available to the starter goes down even<br>further.<br><br>In addition to having clean, corrosion-free connections<br>on your batteries, it’s important to have the correct size lug<br>connections on the ends of your battery cables. Lugs come in<br>many sizes. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen boats<br>where the battery and electrical cables were grossly mismatched.<br>The typical marine or commercial battery has a 5/16-inch post.<br>I have seen a boat owner use a 3/4-inch lug that was too big and<br>floated loosely on the post. To get a better fit they sandwiched<br>the lug with washers. This is not good practice! Matching the<br>correct size and type of lug on the cable to the post will provide<br>a much more secure and electrically superior connection to the<br>battery.<br><br>To clean battery and other important connections, I use<br>a rag moistened with a little kerosene or diesel fuel to remove<br>any preservative or grease, then a red Scotch-Brite pad, fine<br>sandpaper or a small wire brush. (Be careful not to remove too<br>much of the soft copper or lead surfaces you are cleaning!)<br>After cleaning and reconnecting the battery terminals, I highly<br>recommend coating them with one of the several anti-corrosion<br>products like CRC, Permatex or Gunk. These are available in<br>spray cans at auto parts stores or your local chandlery, and<br>provide good protection from battery acids and salt water, and<br>help keep corrosion at bay.<br><br>The same principles apply to the other electrical<br>connections on the boat, especially those that may occasionally<br>draw a lot of current. Master battery switches, autopilots and<br>master electrical panel switches are all candidates due to the<br>environment in which they exist. It’s common practice in the<br>electrical power industry to routinely inspect and possibly shut<br>down power panels to re-torque the nuts and bolts that hold the<br>electric connections together. Admittedly, we aren’t producing<br>the high currents and voltages that commercial power plants are,<br>but considering the more challenging marine environment our<br>boats live in and the continuing movement and vibration found<br>on boats, it’s not a bad idea to do an annual corrosion inspection<br>on the battery and other high current connections. Additionally<br>I’d suggest that every five years or so a closer look at the other<br>electrical connections may be in order.<br><br>Tannis #7, over hard in a fresh breeze in 2018 in Rockland,<br>with no shortage of crew holding down the windward rail.<br>(Bill Finch photo)<br><br></p>
