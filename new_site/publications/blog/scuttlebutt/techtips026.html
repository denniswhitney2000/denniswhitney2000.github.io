            <p>Tech Tips:<br>Cleaning Your Fresh Water Tank<br><br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>One of the problems we face every spring is cleaning<br>the fresh water tank and water lines on the boat before heading<br>out for summertime adventures. The goal is to kill and flush out<br>all of the nasty algae and bacteria that have been growing in the<br>fresh water system since last fall. There are several ways to<br>accomplish the task, and several steps in the method described<br>here. First you have to drain as much of the anti-freeze and old<br>water out of the system as you can. This includes all the water<br>lines, water heater (if you have one), and faucets.<br><br>After draining the system take a quarter cup of house-<br>hold bleach for every fifteen gallons of water that your fresh<br>water tank holds. Mix the bleach with water, filling a<br>one-gallon container and pour about one fourth of it into the<br>fresh water tank. Let this sit for 5-10 minutes, since most of the<br>‘bad actors’ are in the bottom of your tank. Then add the<br>remainder of the water/bleach mix and fill the fresh water tank<br>as full as you can with water. Turn the water pump on, open all<br>the faucets and run the water until you smell the bleach at each<br>faucet, then close the faucets and shut off the pump. If the boat<br>is in the water go for a sail so the water can move around to<br>assist in cleaning the entire tank. Let it sit for at least 12 hours.<br>Drain the entire system again and re-fill the fresh water tank<br>with potable water. Make sure you use a white non-toxic drink-<br>ing hose with an inline water filter to refill the system. Hoses<br>not labeled safe for drinking water can contribute to lead and<br>other dangerous chemicals getting into the water. Open all of<br>the faucets and run the water until you no longer smell any<br>bleach. It may be necessary to refill and drain your tank with<br>fresh water again to eliminate all signs of bleach from the<br>system. Once this is done it is safe to use your water system.<br><br>Got questions? Need answers? Bill is happy to respond to<br>FSS members' inquiries and technical questions.
