            <p>During recent meetings and gatherings we've been asking your<br>opinion on ways to broaden the appeal for this newsletter.<br>Several folks have suggested that articles on various marine<br>systems or boat maintenance may be beneficial. Hopefully, this<br>column will be a forum for sharing the vast range of practical<br>experience accumulated by our membership. It is also intended<br>to be the place where you, the reader, can submit technical<br>questions and either obtain answers or direction to appropriate<br>reference material.<br><br>Of course since I was among the first to suggest such an<br>article, I was elected to write the first one. Having no more<br>direction than to "fill about a page" gave me license to write<br>about a subject that I always seem to be questioned on, namely,<br>marine electrical systems. Unfortunately one page won't be<br>quite enough room. So in order to keep things manageable, and<br>give me more material for future pages, I've divided "marine<br>electrical systems" into the six topics that seem to be trouble<br>areas for the average boaters. These are; electrical wiring,<br>alternators and regulators, batteries, grounding and bonding,<br>radios and antennas, and instrumentation (depth, speed, GPS,<br>LORAN, etc.).<br><br>Have you ever watched someone with an electrical problem<br>step out of their boat with that look that says "there be monsters<br>there"? Usually the look is followed immediately by the<br>question "Hey, do you know anything about ....... 2". 90% of the<br>time the problem is easy to fix (provided you have enough<br>money). The biggest contributor to most of the problems I've<br>witnessed is the wiring that hooks everything together or the<br>connectors used to join the wires to the devices. Corrosion,<br>improper wire, undersized wire, over-rated circuit breaker and<br>fuses, and generally poor wire installations are the "monsters"<br>that you can control if you know the right way to do things and<br>the things to avoid.<br><br>Never use solid wire on a boat. Solid wire is great for the<br>house or barn. They don't move or flex very much (or at least<br>you hope they don't). Boats on the other hand are subjected to<br>all the abuse that the sea provides, plus the vibration of an<br>engine in most boats. Solid wire cannot survive in this environ-<br>ment for very long without fracturing. The only wire that<br>should be used is multi-strand copper wire that will flex with<br>the boat. Ideally you should use tinned multi-strand copper<br>wire. It has a silvery looking coat of tin alloy on each strand of<br>wire and withstands the corrosive marine environment very<br>well.<br><br>Always use wire that is large enough to handle the peak<br>current load of all devices that will be connected to it. The<br>maximum current rating for a wire is dependent on the size of<br>the wire and its length. Using too small a wire will result in a<br>voltage drop at the device end of the wire that may cause erratic<br>operation. Even worse, the wire can overheat to the point of<br>melting the insulation, causing a potential short circuit, and the<br>fire that could result would certainly ruin your day. Most<br>marine stores only carry wire that is meant for the marine<br><br>environment and are reasonably knowledgeable in determining<br>the right size for a given application. BUT ---if they say they<br>don't know, or you are not confident with their judgment don't<br>buy. Remember the boat you sink may be your own! There are<br>a lot of good books on the market that will help you pick the<br>right size wire.<br><br>Always run wire from a fuse or circuit breaker on the main<br>power distribution panel. The only exception to this general<br>rule may be the wiring for the bilge pump and its' switch. If<br>you are connecting directly to the battery make sure that its<br>in-line fuse is located as close to the battery as possible. New<br>boats are usually supplied with circuit breaker panels. The<br>circuit breaker should be rated to protect the wire hooked to it,<br>not the device that is being connected. In a properly designed<br>system the device or instrument has its own fuse, either internal<br>to the instrument or supplied externally as an in-line fuse. In<br>most cases the fuse supplied with the equipment will protect it<br>better than a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker and fuse<br>should always be connected to the positive (+) side of the line.<br>(Note: In the extremely rare circumstance that your boat has a<br>positive ground system, call me, I would like to sce it!) Most<br>wiring schemes use white and black or red and black insulation<br>on the multi-strand tinned wire to identify its polarity. A cover-<br>ing of gray or tan PVC insulation further protects these wire<br>pairs. The black wire is normally the negative (-) side that is<br>connected via a bus bar and heavy wire cable to the negative<br>side of the battery, or a common point such as the engine block.<br>The white or red wire is the positive (+) side which is connected<br>to the positive side of the battery via the circuit breaker panel.<br>If you are not sure of the polarity of the wiring DON'T HOOK<br>ANY NEW EQUIPMENT TO IT! Reversing the polarity of the<br>wiring to expensive electronics equipment could cause signifi-<br>cant damage to it and your wallet.<br><br>Wiring systems should be well laid out with the wires neatly<br>bundled and supported. Always run the wire in its' PVC jacket<br>all the way from the equipment to the circuit breaker panel and<br>then open the jacket to connect the white wire to the circuit<br>breaker (+) and black wire to the negative (-) bus bar. Never,<br>never run a single positive wire from the circuit breaker pancl<br>to a piece of equipment and connect the negative side to another<br>black wire or your radio ground plate. If you do (or, God<br>forbid, have) disconnect the wire immediately. This condition<br>can set up an enormous electrolysis problem for all the under-<br>water metal fittings, the engine and saltwater cooled heat<br>exchangers.<br><br>Always run the wires in pairs all the way back to the circuit<br>breaker panel and negative bus bar. Ideally, groups of wires<br>should be wrapped with tie-wraps every foot or so, or spiral<br>wrapped, and secured to a bulkhead or structural part of the<br>boat to reduce the effects of vibration on the wire. One word of<br>caution - avoid wrapping AC conductors and DC conductors in<br>the same bundle. Run side by side for any appreciable length<br><br>(Continued to Page 6)<br>you can induce quite a bit of noise into the DC wires connected<br>to the instruments. When we talk about radio installations in<br>future articles I'll point out some other conditions to avoid<br>relative to the radio frequency energy given off by the radio,<br>antennas and antenna cables. As I pointed out earlier there are<br>many excellent references on the subject of boat wiring. The<br>“12 Volt Bible”, “Boatowners Illustrated Handbook of Wiring”,<br>and other books are available from most good chandlers and<br>catalogs. Gordon West's articles in “Sail Magazine” are excel-<br>lent references, and well worth reading. In fact, the Dec '97<br>and Jan '98 issues of “Sail Magazine” carried two excellent<br>articles complete with illustrations and further references.<br><br>Hopefully this "about a page" long article has stirred up some<br>questions. Certainly your electrical system should not be<br>viewed as a "monster". With a little knowledge and occasional<br>tender loving care you can easily tame it and save yourself some<br>money in repair bills.<br></p>
