            <p>Tech Tips #18, Give Me a Little<br><br>Leeway<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>As Friendship Sloop sailors we all have experienced<br>leeway at one time or another. All vessels are subject to it, except<br>with the wind dead ahead or astern. Sailing vessels make lots of<br>leeway when hard on the wind and less leeway when well off the<br>wind. Light airs and heavy winds have more impact than moder-<br>ate breezes. When you are trying to get from point A to point B,<br>leeway is one of the elements that you have to consider along<br>with currents, tides and wind direction. Admittedly, current and<br>wind direction usually have more of an effect on a vessel, but if<br>you are on a long leg, vessel leeway can really add up.<br><br>There are several ways to estimate your boat’s leeway;<br>the most effective ways deal with looking astern and watching<br>where you have been. Choose either of these methods to make a<br>rough estimate of your boat's leeway angle:<br><br>The first method is to simply watch your wake as you<br>steer a straight course. Take a bearing on your wake trail using<br>your primary compass (if it’s binnacle mounted and high enough)<br>or a handbearing compass to estimate leeway angle. Using either<br>compass, take a bearing dead astern. Wait several minutes, then<br>sight along the wake line to windward. The difference in the two<br>angles gives you your leeway angle.<br><br>The second method is to use a bearing to an object<br>astern. First find a landmark, light structure, or buoy dead astern.<br>Take a bearing with your compass. Hold a steady course for<br>several minutes, and then take a second bearing. The difference in<br>bearings is your leeway angle.<br><br>Now that you know how much the boat is slipping<br>sideways you can correct for it by adding or subtracting your<br>observed leeway angle from the compass course you are steering.<br>Be sure to apply correction to your steering course in the proper<br>direction. You want to steer the boat closer to the wind to<br>counteract the effect of leeway. If the wind blows from the port<br>side, subtract the angle from your course. If the wind blows from<br>the starboard side, add the leeway angle to your course.<br><br>For example, you are close-reaching on the starboard<br>tack, steering a course of 300 degrees magnetic. You sight astern<br>with the handbearing compass for a reading of 120 degrees<br>magnetic. Five minutes later, you sight down the wake line, and<br>the bearing is 114 degrees magnetic. The difference gives you a<br>leeway angle of 6 degrees. You'll need to point 6 degrees higher,<br>so add the angle to your 300 degree course and steer a new course<br>of 306 degrees magnetic.<br><br>Note that this correction may also include a component<br>of current correction because you could easily be in an area where<br>the current is pushing the boat sideways. Normally the current has<br>an equal effect on both the boat and the wake it leaves but in<br>some areas the currents can be quite tricky, flowing faster in one<br>part of a bay than in another. After you have estimated your<br>boat’s leeway in different wind velocities and at different wind<br>angles a few times you get a good feel for the corrections that you<br>need to make and can make them on a “seat of the pants” basis.<br><br>See you on the water!<br></p>
