            <h2>Friendship Memorial Scholarship Fund</h2>
            <h3>Formerly the Pendleton Memorial Scholarship Fund</h3>
            <p>This scholarship fund was proposed by William Pendleton, owner of the Friendship Sloop <strong>Blackjack</strong>, in 1967. He was a life-long educator from Searsport, who thought that a scholarship fund for the young people of Friendship would serve as a "Thank You" to all the people of the town for the services provided the members of the society during the regattas while they were being held in Friendship.</p>
            <p>In November of 1983 the Friendship Sloop Society turned the fund into a trust, with townspeople being named as trustees. The income of the trust is to be used for the "residents of the Town of Friendship, Maine, in the form of a scholarship for those who are seeking to further their post high school education."</p>
            <p>Applications for scholarships may be obtained at the Guidance Office at Medomak Valley High School or from Phil Pratt in Friendship. Applications must be completed before June 1.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In 2021 five seniors from Friendship, ME were awarded $3500 each, and five Continuing Education students each received $1800.</p>
            <p>In 2021, the Fund Trustees also launched the very "Creative Ways to Gift" Program to accept non-cash gifts.</p>
            <p>There are 8 basic ways that you may give gifts to the Scholarship Fund:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cash</li>
                <li>Stock</li>
                <li>Real Estate and Business Interests</li>
                <li>Other Personal Property</li>
                <li>Life Insurance</li>
                <li>IRAs and Other Retirement Funds</li>
                <li>Assets of a Private Foundation</li>
                <li>Bequests</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are many advantages to using each of these creative gift-giving options to support the Fund.</p>
            <p>If you would like more information on the non-cash options, please contact Jennifer Richard at the Maine Community Foundation for a confidential discussion about your giving ideas at (207) 412-0833, or e-mail her at <a href="mailto:jrichard@mainecf.org">jrichard@mainecf.org</a>.

The dollars generated will be made available to the Fund Trustees "For Distribution" in support of scholarship awards.</p>
