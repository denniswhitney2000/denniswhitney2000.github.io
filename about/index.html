                        <p>The Friendship Sloop Society, a non-profit organization recognized under IRS 501(c)(3) status, was established in 1961 with the mission to preserve, restore, and sail the iconic Friendship Sloop. This organization traces its origins to a storied maritime heritage centered on the coastal fishing communities of Maine in the late 19th century.</p>
                        <p>The founding members of the Friendship Sloop Society were a dedicated group of enthusiasts who recognized the historical and cultural significance of these elegant vessels. Among the notable founding members were Edward "Ned" Ackerman, Charles "Charlie" Burnham, and Roger Duncan. These individuals, along with others, were instrumental in bringing together like-minded sailors and historians to form an organization that would ensure the preservation of the Friendship Sloop for future generations.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the need to preserve these vessels, the Friendship Sloop Society was founded with a dual purpose: to gather, restore, and sail these remarkable boats, and to educate the public about their historical significance. The Society's efforts have been instrumental in maintaining the legacy of the Friendship Sloop, allowing modern generations to connect with a tangible part of Maine's maritime past.</p>
                        <p>One of the key events organized by the Society is the annual Homecoming Regatta, held in Rockland, Maine. This event, which began in 1961, brings together Friendship Sloops from all over the region for a series of races and celebrations. The Homecoming Regatta has become a cherished tradition, attracting sailors and admirers alike to witness these vessels in action and celebrate their enduring legacy.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the Homecoming Regatta, the Society also hosts various educational programs, workshops, and social events throughout the year. These activities aim to foster a sense of community among Friendship Sloop owners and enthusiasts, while also promoting the preservation and appreciation of these historic vessels.</p>
                        <p>Through its efforts, the Friendship Sloop Society has successfully maintained the Friendship Sloop's legacy, ensuring that these living artifacts of maritime history continue to sail the waters of New England. The Society's commitment to preservation, education, and community has allowed the Friendship Sloop to remain a vibrant and cherished part of Maine's maritime heritage.</p>

                <h2>What is the Friendship Sloop</h2>
                <div class="history-section">
                    <div class="history-text">
                        <img src="/img/tern.jpg" alt="Tern line drawing" class="history-image responsive-image" />
                        <p>The Friendship Sloop, a quintessential symbol of American maritime heritage, traces its origins to the late 19th century in the coastal town of Friendship, Maine. These versatile and robust vessels were initially designed and built by local shipwrights to meet the demanding needs of the region's fishermen. The Friendship Sloop's design is a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the maritime community, reflecting a deep understanding of the harsh conditions of the Gulf of Maine.</p>
                        <p>The inception of the Friendship Sloop can be attributed to the collaborative efforts of several master boatbuilders, most notably Wilbur A. Morse, who is often credited with refining the design that would become iconic. Morse, along with other builders such as Charles Morse and Robert McLain, played a pivotal role in the development and proliferation of these sloops. Their designs were characterized by a graceful sheer line, a deep and secure cockpit, and a spacious deck, making them ideal for both fishing and coastal trading.</p>
                        <p>Friendship Sloops were primarily used for lobstering, seining, and hand-lining, activities that required a stable and seaworthy vessel capable of handling the unpredictable weather and rough seas of the North Atlantic. The sloops were typically rigged with a single mast and a large mainsail, complemented by a jib and staysail, which provided excellent maneuverability and speed. The hulls were constructed from locally sourced pine and oak, materials chosen for their durability and availability.</p>
                        <p>The design of the Friendship Sloop evolved over time, incorporating feedback from the fishermen who relied on them daily. Early models were around 21 to 30 feet in length, but as the demand for larger carrying capacity grew, so did the size of the sloops, with some reaching up to 50 feet. Despite these changes, the core attributes of the sloop—its stability, ease of handling, and seaworthiness—remained constant.</p>
                        <p>By the early 20th century, the advent of gasoline engines and more modern fishing vessels began to overshadow the traditional Friendship Sloop. However, the sloop's legacy was far from over. Many of these vessels were preserved and repurposed for recreational sailing, a testament to their enduring appeal and robust construction. The Friendship Sloop Society, founded in 1961, has played a crucial role in preserving and promoting the history and use of these iconic boats. The society organizes annual regattas and gatherings, fostering a community of enthusiasts and ensuring that the Friendship Sloop remains a living part of maritime heritage.</p>
                        <p>Today, the Friendship Sloop is celebrated not only for its historical significance but also for its aesthetic beauty and sailing performance. These vessels are a common sight at classic boat shows and maritime museums, where they are admired for their elegant lines and historical importance. The Friendship Sloop stands as a symbol of the ingenuity and resilience of the coastal communities of Maine, a living link to a bygone era of sail-powered fishing and coastal trade.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Friendship Sloop is more than just a type of boat; it is a cultural icon that embodies the spirit of American maritime history. From its origins in the small town of Friendship, Maine, to its continued presence in the world of recreational sailing, the Friendship Sloop represents a proud tradition of craftsmanship, innovation, and community. Its story is a testament to the enduring legacy of the men and women who built, sailed, and preserved these remarkable vessels.</p>

                <h2>Friendship Town Museum</h2>
                <p>Each year the Sloop Society has donated a sum of money to the Friendship Museum. The museum houses artifacts of the Town of Friendship and Friendship Sloops. This article appeared in the book <i>"It's a Friendship".</i></p>
                <p>A long felt need was finally met with the opening of the Friendship Museum in 1964. Al Roberts, a local lobster dealer had collected numerous articles having to do with Friendship's two most important industries: lobstering and boat building, but he had no place available to display them properly. His idea was to set up a Museum filled with the memories of the town, its ways, and its people. This idea smoldered for a couple of years, and burst into being with the new interest brought about by the birth of the Friendship Sloop Society in 1961. By 1963, permission was given by the Foster family to use the one-room, brick schoolhouse as a Museum. The Friendship Museum was incorporated in February, 1964 and its doors were opened in June of that year with an open house party attended by 400 people. Before the first season was over, 2500 visitors had signed the guest book.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Wardell McFarland was available for the job of curator and a more knowing one would have been hard to come by. "Carrie" as she is generally known, was a stepdaughter of Jonah Morse, (Wilbur's partner and yard foreman for years). The answer to any question pertaining to Friendship is generally on the tip of her tongue. She has intrigued visitors from far and near with her local knowledge, and is in love with her job.</p>
                <p>The building itself is a museum piece. It was built in 1851 as a one room schoolhouse. To discourage the practice of moving the schoolhouse each year when a new school board was elected, it was decided it should be built of brick. Thus it has stood at its present location for 114 years, which might be a record for Maine Schoolhouses.</p>
                <p>In 1923 it was abandoned, and remained unused until the Condon family bought it and remodeled it in 1927. A cement floor was poured, and a fireplace added. It served as a community meeting place until the Museum was opened in 1964. At that time it was cleaned up, painted, and pointed up and now serves as a charming resting place for an intriguing history of a wonderful town. The building itself is responsible for much of the charm of the Museum.</p>
                <p>The thought that every time a home was broken up, sold, or burned, a part of the history of the town was lost, was disturbing. Now much of the memorabilia of Friendship is housed and proudly displayed in a reasonably fireproof building where anyone who is interested may spend hours looking at pictures and records of the town. While this is not strictly a marine museum, a great part of it necessarily has to do with the sea because of the location of Friendship. The sloops for which the town is famous play an important part in our history and in our Museum, but we show every aspect of our friendly little town. What the future will bring is a difficult question to answer. Already we have more articles than we can display. Will the Museum grow and prosper? Will it remain as it is? Will it die because of lack of interest and funds? So far we are optimistic. Time will tell.</p>
                <p>Betty Roberts sent along an update to this story: We are open July and August and by appointment other times. We published a book "Friendship Long Island" as related by Iran Morse on island living in older days. We also have two beautiful model Friendship sloops on display, built with the hold.</p>
