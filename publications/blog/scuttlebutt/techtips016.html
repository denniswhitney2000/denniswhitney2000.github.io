            <p>Tech Tip - A Dinghy Dolly<br>by Bill Whitney<br><br>I needed wheels to move my rather hefty Newman<br>dinghy from the storage area to the floating boat ramp. Instead of<br>fixed wheels I decided that a simple, removable wheeled fixture<br>that floats would be the best approach. The design goals were<br>these: support the dinghy, be easily removable, not corrode,<br>move smoothly over packed gravel and wood surfaces, and store<br>easily either in the dinghy or ashore. Rolling easily requires large<br>wide wheels. So the first stop was to Lowes and Home Depot to<br>find what they may have in largest plastic wheels that would<br>support the weight and have enough of a footprint to move over<br>the gravel surface at the boat yard and not sink. Lowes had the<br>best selection. There I found a pair of 8” diameter, 1” wide<br>plastic wheels with 3/8” axle holes that would do the job. At first<br>I thought it may take four wheels, two on each side, but with the<br>gravel surface two wheels provided enough surface area to<br>support the weight. Somewhere in the past I saw a dinghy that<br>had the wheels on hinged bracket permanently mounted on the<br>centerline of the transom. The centerline mounting I liked, but<br>not the hinged mount. Having sailed a lot of dinghies with<br>removable rudders the idea of mounting the wheels like a rudder<br>with pintles and gudgeons struck me as an idea that might work<br>and attaching a pair of gudgeons to the transom wouldn’t alter<br>the dinghy’s good looks. In the scrap pile I found a 24” X 3” X<br>%” piece of hard pine that was longer that the transom was high<br>and set to work. The pictures below show the results.<br><br>I wanted to be able to mount the wheels so they would<br>function with the dinghy right side up or inverted which is her<br>winter storage position. The pintle/gudgeon configuration works<br>well but I found that a horizontal cross brace was needed to keep<br>the wheels from turning if you had to push the boat backwards.<br>The axle is a piece of 3/8” bronze rod that has bronze pins and<br>washers holding the wheels in position. The wheel assembly<br>floats upright and stores nicely in the bottom of the dinghy.<br>When the dinghy hits the water all you need to do is wiggle the<br>wheel assembly and push down. There has never been an<br>outboard motor on the boat (I prefer rowing!) but think that the<br>upper gudgeon would not interfere with one. This design works<br>well for me and doesn’t detract from the classic lines of the<br>dinghy. It’s hard to pin down a cost for the assembly since most<br>of the pieces were left over from past projects, but my best guess<br>would be less than $50.<br></p>
