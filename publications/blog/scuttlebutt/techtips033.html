            <p>Homebrew Bronze Cleaners<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>Every now and then you come across something in a<br>nautically oriented publication that not only applies to a Friend-<br>ship sloop, but also really works. Here are two recipes for<br>homemade bronze cleaner that I picked up from an old copy of<br>Practical Sailor. I have edited it slightly to remove superfluous<br>information.<br><br>“Lest you think multi-billion-dollar chemical companies<br>and their geeks in white lab coats have a lock on cleaning your<br>bronze, there are numerous homebrewed cleaning solutions that<br>folks claim have the ability to put a shine on your bronze and a<br>gleam in your eye. We decided to test two of these strange<br>brews. Below are the recipes and our test results. These recipes<br>were pulled from the Internet,<br><br>HOME BREW NO. 1: SALT AND VINEGAR PASTE<br>Recipe: Dissolve 3 teaspoons of salt into 1 cup of white vinegar.<br>Add enough flour to make a paste, and then scoop the paste onto<br>a clean sponge and polish. Rinse with hot water and buff dry<br>with a soft cloth.<br><br>Result: This polish worked surprisingly well. While it took a<br>little scrubbing, and we had to let the tougher stains soak for 10<br>to 15 minutes, it worked well overall and earned a rating of<br>“Good” on our'test scale.<br><br>HOME BREW NO. 2: LEMON PASTE<br>Recipe: Polish with a soft cloth soaked in a solution of lemon<br>juice and baking soda, or sprinkle baking soda on a slice of<br>lemon and scrub. (We made a paste as in Brew No. 1.)<br>Result: After the mini-volcanic reaction of mixing lemon juice<br>and baking soda settled down, the resulting paste powered off<br>the stains exceptionally well with minimal scrubbing. We tried<br>using a slice of lemon, but the cloth held up better and worked<br>best while rubbing—it was also less messy. This home brew<br>polish earned a solid rating of “Very good” on our test scale,<br>comparable with many of our top commercially produced<br>performers.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>Overall, the results in the home brew category were<br>pretty impressive, particularly considering that they have all<br>natural ingredients and that both are economical to make. While<br>the Brews Nos. 1 and 2 cleaned the bronze, they lacked the<br>“luster” of products such as the Miracle Cloth. Following up the<br>cleaning with a coat of wax would add shine and additional<br>protection.”<br><br>I like, and have used, both recipes. I personally like<br>Home Brew #2 for two reasons. We usually don’t have enough<br>salt or flour on board to mix a batch for recipe #1, but we<br>certainly have more than enough left-over lemons (or limes)<br>from our evening consumption of Tangueray gin and tonic. So<br>taise a glass to Home Brew #2!<br></p>
