            <p>Tech Tips<br>by Bill Whitney<br><br>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical experience accumulated by our membership and not just my favorite<br>boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either obtain direct<br>answers in this column or direction to appropriate reference material.<br><br>I love the reunions in Rockland, ME. They provide a cornucopia of problems waiting to be explored and sometimes even solved.<br>This last year, we (1 take the liberty of using the collective “we” here since “we the fleet” seem to share our problems somewhat<br>universally) had one problem that had us stumped for a few hours. The problem was an overheating Atomic 4. Although the<br>pedigree of this venerable power plant may be questionable, and its’ recorded maintenance records nonexistent, it was evident that<br>the patient had provided many, many years of reliable propulsion; unti] now. Oh it was rusty and there was evidence of a leak or two,<br>but it had served the boat and its’ owner’s for many years. (1 almost wrote “served its’ owner’s very well” but having owned an<br>Atomic 4 once myself thought that the statement was a little too generous.) The engine ran fine at an idle, but overheated when run<br>much above that under load. For a nautically obsessed ‘techy’ like me the plot had all the makings of a good murder mystery!<br><br>Troubleshooting started with the normal checks oil level and pressure, coolant flow, fouled plugs, etc. But nothing was really<br>obviously wrong. The one thing that may have been amiss was that the exhaust had more steam in it than what you would consider<br>normal. And yes, there was water coming out the exhaust, so you knew that the raw water pump was working, but engine seemed<br>hotter than it should have been. Well, if the pump is OK the next possibility is the thermostat, right? So we braved the rusty nuts<br>and got lucky. Quite to our surprise, the thermostat housing came apart fairly easily. Everything inside even looked good. The<br>thermostat was in place, there was nothing plugging the passageways, and the thermostat still opened and closed so it seemed to be<br>capable of operating correctly. Just to verify that this was not the problem, we decided to reassemble the thermostat housing without<br>the thermostat and see if that made any difference in the water flow. No such luck! Even without the thermostat the water flow<br>seemed too low and again there was steam in the exhaust after a few minutes of engine operation.<br><br>Checking the seacock on the raw water intake didn’t reveal any restrictions, so next we tried looking for a blockage in the hoses.<br>Nothing obvious here either. Using a hose connected to the fresh water spigot on the pier we jury-rigged the hose so we could back-<br>flush the cooling system components one section at a time. Finally problems started to show up. We found a restriction at the exhaust<br>manifold but were able to restore flow by expert application of a high tech coat hanger. Unfortunately, this fix didn’t solve the<br>overall problem because the exhaust manifold water flow is in parallel with water flow through the engine block. But (Eureka!) with<br>the water being supplied through the hose rigged to the pier the engine was not overheating.<br><br>But why? The pump was pumping. The only thing left to do was to tear down the pump and take a detailed look at its’ interior<br>parts. At first we just removed the front cover to take a look at the impeller. The most obvious thing to look for is a broken or<br>missing vane. the easy answer was not among the choices. The impeller was in good shape. All of the vanes were there. And when<br>we removed the pump from the engine, observed that there was no major wear on the tips, and there was no major wear on the<br>bronze pump housing either. But almost by accident we discovered that there was quite a bit of rotational play between the shaft and<br>the impeller. When the shaft and impeller were removed from the housing and separated there was quite a bit of wear on the shaft in<br>the area where the impeller mates to it. The shaft is machined in a “D” shaped pattern. This design relies on the flat side of the “D”<br>to prevent the impeller from turning on the shaft. However, if you looked at the worn area on the shafi, you would see that the design<br>failed. The impeller had to be slipping on the shaft in order to cause this wear pattern.<br><br>A root cause analysis of the overheating coupled with the evidence we found during the troubleshooting shows how it was<br><br>happening.<br><br>The engine ran at an idle, not overheating.<br><br>Coolant flow was observed at the exhaust outlet.<br><br>The impeller slipped on the shaft, but not until moderate force was applied.<br><br>As engine RPM increases the impeller RPM increases more coolant should be pumped through the engine and exhaust system.<br>As engine RPM increased the flow rate of the coolant did not appear to increase.<br><br>As engine RPM increases the back pressure of the water flow through the system will increase.<br><br>The increased back pressure on the vanes of the impeller was enough to prevent the pump shaft, which is turning at a propor-<br>tional speed to the engine, from turning the impeller at the same speed, as evidenced by the wear pattern on the shaft.<br><br>TAWA WN<br><br>Now that we found the problem the fix was easy. Actually it was easier that we originally thought because another Friendship, with<br>an identical power plant, had a rebuild kit aboard with a new shaft, seal and impeller. Reassembled and installed the pump back on<br>the engine solved the problem. The engine ran cool at both low and high RPM and the water flow through the exhaust increased<br>with the RPM just like it should.<br><br>So the moral of the story is that if you have a cooling problem with your Atomic 4 you need to check out the raw water pump<br>impeller and more importantly the impeller shaft. The problem we experienced is somewhat unusual. I was very surprised to see the<br>degree of wear. The design lends itself to failure unless you inspect it at least annually and know what you are looking for. 1 don’t<br>think that you would see this type of wear unless you removed the shaft. Happy Sailing!<br></p>
