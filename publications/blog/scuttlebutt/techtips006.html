            <p>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical experience accumulated by our membership and<br>not just my favorite boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place where you, the reader, can ask technical<br>questions and either obtain direct answers in this column or direction to appropriate reference material.<br><br>Since you have not asked for specifics since the last newsletter, I'll continue on course with the original list of<br>topics. Just to refresh your memory the topics are: electrical wiring, alternators and regulators, batteries, grounding<br>and bonding, radios and antennas, and instrumentation (depth, speed, GPS, LORAN, etc.). We have already<br>covered wiring, alternators and regulators, batteries, bonding and grounding so let's look at the normal problems<br>encountered with radios and antennas; poor performance or no performance. An interesting fact about these<br>problems is that the radio and antenna are usually not at fault. The problems are usually associated with the quality<br>of the original installation and/or how long they have been exposed to the marine environment.<br><br>Every topic we have covered so far supports the basic requirements needed to provide power to a radio or other<br>electrical devices that you may have aboard. Radios have some special requirements that your starter motor or<br>running lights could care less about. All of the other accessories onboard may be operating just fine but the radio,<br>specifically the marine VHF, just doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to when it was new. What could be<br>wrong?<br><br>Well, if you still have the operating manual that came with it, see if you can pry the pages apart and look at the<br>specifications. Most VHF radios, fixed mount VHF radios and handhelds, come with a page of specifications that<br>really don't mean very much unless you're an engineer. So most of us look at them when we pull the radio out of<br>the box, look at the installation instructions, then proceed to install the unit where we want it, regardless of what<br>the instructions say.<br><br>If you go back to the specifications you may discover that the hasty installation a few years ago set the stage for<br>the problems you are experiencing now. Look at the specification table and find out how much current the radio<br>needs to operate at its full power rating of 25 Watts. In most cases a fixed mount radio will draw 6 to 10 Amps and<br>require between 11.5 to 15 Volts (at the fuse on the back of the radio) when it is operating correctly.<br><br>What size wire did you use to hook things up between the circuit breaker panel and the fuse? A few articles ago<br>we looked at wire size and the amount of current a given size wire could conduct without a detrimental drop in<br>voltage from one end to the other. If the wire size was marginal when the original installation was performed, or<br>the power connector or any other connection between the power source and radio is corroded you are not providing<br>enough power (remember Volts X Amps = Power (in Watts)) to the radio. Cleaning the connections (an easy task)<br>or installing the correct size wire (a not so easy task) will allow the radio to operate the way it was designed.<br><br>An important thing to note here is that the total power required to operate the radio is HIGHER than the Radio<br>Frequency (RF) power output from the radio. By law, marine VHF (Very High Frequency) radios are limited to a<br>maximum of 25 Watts RF output. Due to the power lost internally, due to heating of components and other ineffi-<br>ciencies, you have to supply over twice the RF output power at the 12-Volt DC input. If you look at the typical<br>specs in the last paragraph and multiply 6 Amps X 12 Volts you see that you have to provide 72 Watts at the input<br>to get the rated power of 25 Watts RF at the output. Depending on your radio's specification this requirement could<br>be much higher.<br><br>The other chief contributor to poor performance is the connection(s) between the radio's RF output connector and<br>the antenna. Most Friendships have at least 50 feet of coaxial cable and two PL-59 connectors between the back of<br>the VHF and its antenna. RF cable connections that are well sealed will normally last several years. The worst<br>enemy to the connections and coaxial cables is moisture! Especially salt moisture! Obviously we get plenty of that<br>on the ocean so our goal has to be to keep it away from the RF connections, especially the connection at the<br>antenna.<br><br>Moisture that penetrates the plug causes two problems. First, it corrodes the connecting surfaces of the connector,<br>which to a limited degree you can clean off; but the second problem doesn't have an easy fix. As the moisture<br>builds up inside the connector it is carried down the braided outer conductor of the coaxial cable much like the<br>wicking action in an oil lamp. Eventually the coaxial cable gets waterlogged. If corrosion doesn't ruin the cable<br>where it joined the connector; the gradual saturation of the cable interior will either short circuit the inner and<br>outer conductors or change the impedance to something other than the 50 Ohms called for by those specifications<br>we mentioned earlier. If you have a leaky connector at the antenna you have set yourself up for gradual<br>deterioration of the transmission system that carries the RF signal from your radio to the antenna. then out to the<br>world. The only remedy for a saturated cable is to replace it.<br>So how do you prevent moisture intrusion? Proper assembly techniques and quality materials will keep water<br>out. Some of the basics are:<br>© Purchase good quality material. Equipment made for the marine environment is far superior to, in the long run<br>cheaper than, home electronics or automotive products.<br><br>© Follow the manufacturer's instructions when assembling the connectors. (Personally, I prefer soldered connec-<br>tors, but if you don't have good soldering skills have someone else install them; or use the new PL-259-CP<br>solder-less connectors.)<br><br>© Never connect the connector to the antenna without lubricating the threads. The lubrication keeps moisture<br>from "crawling" down the threads. Be careful not to get the lubrication on the center pin or base of the connec-<br>tor as this could act as an insulator and prevent a good electrical connection.<br><br>© Always tape or heat-shrink the whole assembly after the connections have been completed. An outer layer of<br>self-vulcanizing tape, followed by a layer of vinyl electrical tape provides a good weather-resistant seal. Wind<br>the outer layer of vinyl tape from the lowest point on the coaxial cable up to and over the connector body and<br>finish off by locking the last turn of tape in place with a small black tie-wrap. (Winding from the bottom up<br>gives the tape an overlap like the shingles on your house and the black tie-wrap is more weather resistant than<br>a white one and will prevent the tape from unwinding as the adhesive ages.) Another good finishing touch is<br>to coat the tape with liquid electrical tape or a product called Scotch Coat.<br><br>West Marine, Boat US, Defender, and other marine supply outfitters are good sources of material. The West<br>Marine Catalog is an excellent reference book even if you don't buy anything. The West Advisor pages, included in<br>each product section, provide accurate, informative articles on product selection and performance differences.<br>Their prices may not be the lowest but the catalog is certainly the most informative.<br><br>Now before you go buying new wire, coaxial cable or connectors there are some easy tests you can perform to see<br>if things are really as bad as you think or at least as expensive. Here are some tests you can perform and an inter-<br>pretation of the results.<br><br>1. Turn off all power to the radio.<br><br>2. Perform a visual inspection of the 12-Volt wiring and antenna connections. If corrosion is evident, clean it.<br><br>3. Temporarily reconnect the antenna and 12-Volt power to the radio.<br><br>4. Turn the VHF on and tune in to one of the NOAA weather frequencies.<br><br>* Ifyou can hear the signal clearly, or at least as well as a nearby boat with an antenna as high as yours, the<br>receive side of the system is probably working correctly.<br><br>Turn off all power to the radio.<br><br>6. Disconnect the antenna cable from the back of the radio. With an Ohmmeter, measure the DC continuity of<br>the antenna cable and antenna. Ideally the meter reading should be about 1.5 W (Ohms) or less.<br>© Yes this is correct! VHF antennas are designed to be short circuits to DC currents in order to provide a<br>measure of lightning protection. This low reading indicates that the antenna and cable have good connec-<br>tions, and there are no open circuit conditions in the antenna, cable, or connectors. Additionally, the<br>previous test of the receiver system eliminated the probability that the antenna or cable is short-circuited.<br>If it was you would not have heard the weather broadcast.<br><br>© But if the meter indicated a much higher resistance, which is what we were really testing for, the cable, a<br>connector, or the antenna is either corroded or an open circuit and needs to be repaired. And yes, the<br>receiver can still pick up the weather broadcast and other signals even though the outer conductor of the<br>coaxial cable is not connected to anything.<br><br>7. If the Ohmmeter read more than 1.5 W but less than 5 W the antenna and cable may have a poor connection<br>or the DC resistance of the antenna may be slightly higher than the average antenna, but odds are that the<br>radio will work. (Note that different manufacturers have different resistance specifications for their antennas<br>so there will be a small range of readings from antenna to antenna even though the systems seem to be equal.<br>Differences in coaxial cable lengths also contribute to a slight difference in the measured resistance.)<br><br>8. If the previous test results are good you should be able to hook everything up and successfully use the radio. If<br>it still does not work correctly there is another test that will show you much more than the simple Ohmmeter<br><br>om<br>tests are capable of showing. The instrument used for this test is a RF Watt meter that measures the radio<br>frequency power actually traveling from the radio up to and out of the antenna. More importantly it can also<br>measure the power that cannot be radiated by the antenna due to some problem with the cable, connectors, or<br>antenna. The correct name for this instrument is VSWR Meter, which stands for Voltage Standing Wave Ratio<br>meter. If you have never used one or don't have one to perform this test you should have a qualified technician<br><br>do this test.<br>© The test will show you if there are any kinks, distortion, moisture or other problems in the transmission<br><br>path that may not be visible during a visual inspection.<br><br>If you would like me to check out your VHF radio and the antenna system while we are in Rockland let me know.<br>I'll have some of the basic tools and test equipment with me and will be happy to assist as long as you allow<br>Gaivota to finish the races ahead of your boat. And please, if you do, don't be so obvious as to lower your sails<br><br>before crossing the finish line.<br></p>
