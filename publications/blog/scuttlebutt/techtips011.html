            <p>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical<br>experience accumulated by our membership and not just my<br>favorite boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place<br>where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either<br>obtain direct answers in this column or direction to appropriate<br>reference material.<br><br>This article is another departure from my originally scripted<br>list of topics. In case you don't remember, the topics were electri-<br>cal wiring, alternators and regulators, batteries, grounding and<br>bonding, radios and antennas, and instrumentation (depth, speed,<br>GPS, LORAN, etc.). But due to a recent problem experienced by<br>one of our members I think this maintenance advisory has to take<br>precedence. Although the incident occurred on one of the<br>Pemaquid models | think it could easily happen to any of our<br>boats.<br><br>The occurrence was the loss of a rudder. With a good degree<br>of skill on the part of the skipper and a little luck, he and his first<br>mate made it back to the mooring. No secondary damage was<br>done (as long as you don't count the elevated blood pressure and<br>frayed nerves). But rather than an epic tale of seamanship the<br>focus of this article is how to prevent something like this from<br>happening to you.<br><br>If you recall, a few issues ago (Tech Tips #5) we discussed the<br>problems that can result from improper grounding and bonding<br>of an electrical system in a marine environment. Stray electrical<br>currents, induced either by the presence of dissimilar metals in<br>an electrolyte (like salt water), or those resulting from faulty<br>electrical wiring on a boat (either yours or one near yours) can<br>cause metals to waste away. And that's what appears to have<br>happened in this case. The rudder was lost because the rudder-<br>post, a very substantial piece of bronze, was eaten through just<br>inside the top of the rudder assembly. When the helm was shifted<br>to steer the boat the torque was just enough to twist the rudder-<br>post apart, resulting in loss of steering and the rudder.<br><br>I have not had a chance to inspect the pieces, or have the<br>Materials Engineering folks at work offer their opinion, but<br>knowing a little about the construction standards applied in<br>building the boat, and the materials that were originally used, I<br>doubt that galvanic corrosion is the cause. It seems much more<br>likely that there is an electrical wiring problem on the boat.<br>Hopefully we will have time to troubleshoot that later this<br>winter. | highly recommend that you take the time to go over all<br>the fittings below the waterline while the boat is sitting high and<br>dry this winter and give them a thorough inspection.<br><br>What should you be looking for? Start with a good structural<br>inspection to see if there is any obvious weakness to the fittings.<br>Grab the interior neck of each through hull and give it a good<br>side to side, front to back push. Any quality bronze fitting should<br>be more than able to handle this side load, unless it has lost<br>considerable strength due to corrosion. It is important to remem-<br>ber that you may not be able to see any evidence of corrosion if<br>it is inside the fitting or underneath the hose. Wooden boats have<br>the additional problem in that the hull fastenings could be eaten<br>away in the same manner as the rudderpost but you can't inspect<br>them unless you take things apart.<br><br>For items like the rudder you will more than likely need<br>another person to help you. Someone to hold the rudder and look<br>for any difference in movement between the shaft and body of<br>the rudder, and the other person to move the tiller or wheel.<br>Since most steering systems have a little slop in them (a little<br>slop is a good thing) the person on the helm won't be able to feel<br>the difference between the steering slop and any difference in<br>movement between the rudder and itsâ€™ shaft. The person holding<br>the rudder may need to feel the difference rather than see it.<br>Obviously if you can see the rudder shaft move and the rudder<br>doesn't you have a significant problem. Even the smallest<br>movement of the rudder shaft in a fiberglass rudder assembly,<br>while the rudder is being held in a fixed position, needs to be<br>investigated. Movement could be indicative of a severely<br>weakened shaft, like the one that was the genesis of this article,<br>or a web structure problem inside the rudder that has loosened<br>and you have voids in the rudder that very likely have water in<br>them. The winter freeze and thaw cycles will continue to take<br>their toll until delamination causes a structural failure. If you<br>find any cracks in the fiberglass, you may already have a delami-<br>nation problem.<br><br>Other items that should be inspected is the fit of the propeller,<br>tightness of the prop nut and jam nut, possible bends in the prop<br>shaft, totally wasted zincs or the possibility of a worn rudder heel<br>bearing. If you find that the zinc is severely wasted, or<br>worse.....gone after one season, you really should inspect the<br>submerged fittings thoroughly. Under normal conditions the<br>bronze fittings exposed to salt water should be a nice chocolate<br>brown color. As you are looking at all the fittings be conscious<br>of their color. If they look as though they have a pink hue it<br>could indicate that they are being depleted. If any of these items<br>are corroded take action to fix them before the boat goes back in<br>the water.<br><br>I know it might be cold and it's raining, blowing, snowing and<br>being otherwise miserable, but a little time on and around the<br>boat performing a good visual inspection, and mechanical integ-<br>rity testing, will make the good summer weather a lot less stress-<br><br>ful and it will just seem to last longer.<br></p>
