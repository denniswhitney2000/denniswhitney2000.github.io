            <p>Tech Tips: Swinging the Compass<br><br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>Year after year we repeat the springtime rituals of<br>launching and outfitting our boats. Being creatures of habit we<br>also have a tendency to stow items aboard where they have been<br>for years. But things change. Something new arrives aboard; a<br>new set of tools, a new GPS, or we replace that beloved Teflon-<br>coated frying pan with a new cast iron one.<br>Little things that may seem inconsequential<br>can add up over time. Big changes like an<br>engine refit are more obvious, but both the<br>big and the cumulative small changes can<br>have a significant impact on the magnetic<br>environment that the ship’s compass lives<br>within.<br><br>Checking out the compass, or<br>“swinging the compass” is a procedure that<br>should be conducted annually or whenever<br>the location of anything made of steel or<br>iron changes. It establishes the amount of<br>deviation that the boat’s magnetic field<br>imposes on the compass. When the boat<br>was new, a compass adjuster added<br>compensation magnets, or adjusted those<br>already installed, to counteract the magnetic field of the boat so<br>that the compass pointed to the correct magnetic heading regard-<br>less of the boat’s heading. When the compass adjuster finished<br>installing or adjusting these magnets, a compass deviation card<br>was provided that recorded any remaining deviation error that<br>could not be removed. (You do have it, right? Oh, so it was<br>installed 42 years ago? And you have checked it since, right?).<br><br>The accuracy of your steering compass on all angles of<br>the ship’s heading is really important. This is the one instrument<br>that won’t fail when the power goes out. A check of its perform-<br>ance should be part of your commissioning checklist. It is not<br>only easy but can be accomplished several different ways, using<br>several different “tools” that are already aboard the boat or in<br>your pocket. Of course you could always hire a compass<br>adjuster to come aboard and go through the exacting procedure<br>of comparing the compass headings with the modern version of a<br>gyro-compass, and pay whatever the current cost is, but why not<br>check things out yourself to see if there is a problem before<br>going that route and possibly spending money unnecessarily?<br><br>There are several ways to do it, but the quickest and<br>easiest is to have someone steer due north (000°C) on the steer-<br>ing compass while another person uses a hand bearing compass<br>to sight along the centerline of the boat while standing at the<br>stern, well clear of any magnetic interference. You can also use<br>the compass app on a smart phone (set for magnetic, not true) as<br>long as you can sight along it or keep it aligned with the vessel’s<br>centerline. Have a note pad handy to record the readings of both<br>the steering and handheld compasses and/or smart phone<br>heading. Continue recording bearings every 30° until you have<br>completed a full 360°. Compare the differences between the<br>steering compass and handheld/smart phone headings and record<br>the amount and direction of deviation for each course steered. If<br><br>deviation exceeds 5° on any course, it’s time to hire a profes-<br>sional compass adjuster to correct the compass.<br><br>The 2018 Eldridge Tide and Pilot Book gives a good<br>description of using your GPS; on page 213 for creating a devia-<br>tion card, and on page 209 for adjusting the compass and deter-<br>mining any misalignment problems that<br>may exist between the boat’s centerline<br>and steering compass, not as rare a<br>problem as you may think!<br><br>A third method, although limited to<br>one bearing line because of the timing of<br>the sun, is to check the compass bearing<br>of the sun at sunrise or sunset. Once<br>again, your 2018 Eldridge gives a good<br>description of the process on page 232.<br>One potential drawback with this method,<br>aside from being limited to one bearing,<br>is the cognitive condition of the person<br>taking the bearing. A sunrise bearing<br>assumes one is awake and can recognize<br>the sun when it comes up. The sunset<br>bearing has its own set of issues. The<br>seductive comforts of a quiet cockpit while waiting for sunset<br>may induce additional cognitive problems. The clear liquid<br>refreshments, crackers and cheese, dips, chips and good<br>company can easily cause one to forget entirely about sunset, not<br>recognize that the sun is going down, or be unable to locate the<br>compass. This method may not be terribly productive, but<br>certainly sounds like the most fun!<br><br>aS<br></p>
