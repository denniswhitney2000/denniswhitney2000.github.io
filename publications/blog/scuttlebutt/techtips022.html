            <p>Tech Tips: Lazy Jacks and Topping Lifts<br><br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>One of the greatest consistencies among Friendship sloops are their enduring inconsistencies. Not only do they vary remarka-<br>bly in length and beam but also in standing and running rigs. While proofreading “Lasting Friendships” prior to publication, I was<br>struck by the subtle variations in the running rigging between vessels that I had not noticed before. Two of these stood out: topping<br>lifts and lazy jacks. Most boats had lazy jacks but topping lifts were noticeably absent on some. That, and a question from our stalwart<br>newsletter editor, got me thinking: Why the difference between such similar boats?<br><br>Before getting too far into the discussion, let’s define what we are talking about. “Lazy jacks” are the lines fastened at the<br>boom bail band and run through a cheek block on both sides of the mast, just under the spreaders (if rigged for a topmast), or just<br>under the mast hounds where the shrouds cross below the masthead. The falls are normally distributed evenly along the length of the<br>boom, from the boom bail band to the gooseneck, and the hauling parts are cleated to the port and starboard side of the mast band or<br>pin rail.<br><br>Cheek Block Cheek Block<br><br>Modern Lazy Jack<br>Typical Lazy Jack Arrangement<br><br>Arrangement (Port and stbd side of the mast<br>(Port and stbd side of the and boom)<br>mast and boom) Mast :<br>Boom Bail Boom Bail<br>a =<br><br>Boom Boom<br>Hauling part fastened to either pin band Hauling part fastened to either pin ban<br>on the mast or pin rail on the shrouds on the mast or pin rail on the shrouds<br><br>The modern style lazy jack configuration causes a little less chafe than the traditional version but cannot be used as a topping<br>lift because of the greater angle of pull. However, if bullseyes or miniature blocks are incorporated into the falls they become self<br>adjusting, spreading the load evenly. You can achieve the same thing with the traditional rig but it is somewhat time consuming to<br>adjust each leg individually.<br><br>The primary purpose of the lazy jacks is to contain and control the mainsail as it is raised and lowered. Without lazy jacks the<br>sail will fall off the boom, generally get in the way, and make furling a lot more difficult. On some traditional vessels, especially large<br>gaff-rigged schooners such as Adventure in Gloucester, MA, the lazy jacks serve the dual purpose of controlling the sail, and acting as<br>the topping lift. Obviously, due to the weight of the boom, they are considerably more robust than those on a Friendship sloop, and are<br>usually rigged with a 4 or 6 part tackle at the trestletrees.<br><br>The topping lift also has multiple functions, depending on how the vessel is outfitted, and there are several variations in<br>rigging. In general, the topping lift is rigged from the masthead to the tip, or near the tip, of the boom, and used to lift the boom off the<br>crutch or gallows when raising sail, or for supporting the boom when the gaff is lowered while reefing the sail when already underway.<br>The variations in how the lift is rigged are really dependent on the weight of the boom and the personal preferences of the designer and<br>owner. (See illustrations on the next page)<br><br>Small boats with lighter booms can operate quite sufficiently with a single line run between the boom tip and the masthead<br>and through a single-part block or cheek block, either at the masthead or boom tip. In the masthead block configuration, the fixed end<br>is secured to the boom tip and the hauling part is run up through the block and down the mast, secured at the pin band at the bottom of<br>the mast or the fife rail. The boom tip block configuration for the single part topping lift involves securing the fixed end at the<br>masthead, and running the hauling part through a cheek block near the end of the boom, and passing the line forward through fairleads,<br>to cleat it mid-boom or near the forward end of the boom.<br><br>On larger boats with heavier booms, the arrangements that seem to prevail are those with multi-part tackle with either<br>masthead or boom end attachment. Most prevalent among the larger Friendships is where the fixed end is fastened at the masthead,<br>and various tackle arrangements are used at the boom tip to increase the mechanical advantage needed to handle the heavier boom.<br>Two and three part tackle are often used to gain the advantage. Gaivota, at 31 feet, was originally rigged without a topping lift and I<br>had to use the lazy jacks to raise the boom off the gallows. That only lasted two years. It’s quite a chore for a one-part tackle on a 27’<br>boom and an aging owner! She currently has the topping lift fastened at the masthead and a three-part tackle at the boom aft end. The<br>line passes forward through three fairleads along the boom and is cleated on the starboard boom gooseneck fitting. I like the relative<br>security of handling lines near the shrouds when things get a bit turbulent. Below are a few of the possible topping lift configurations:<br><br>Block<br><br>Three Part Topping Lift<br>fixed at the boom end<br><br>Single Part Topping Lift<br><br>fastened at the mast head Single Part-Topping Lift<br><br>fastened at the boom<br>end,<br><br>Two Part Topping Lift<br>fastened at the mast head<br><br>Mast Mast Mast Mast<br>Topping Lift<br><br>ing Lift Topping Lift Topping Lift<br><br>gut Topping ti ping Lit ping Lift<br><br>Hauling part fastened to<br>acleat or pin on the<br><br>forward end of the<br>Block 0<br><br>Hauling part fastened to<br>either pin band on the<br>‘mast or pin rail on the<br><br>shrouds<br><br>Hauling part fastened<br>to either pin band on<br>the mast or pin rail on<br>the shrouds<br><br>Hauling part fastened to a<br>cleat or pin on the forward<br>end of the boon<br><br>Boom<br><br>Cheek Block Cheek Block<br><br>All rigging options have their pros and cons. When looking at a rigging system, important considerations are: where do you<br>want to control it from, how strong do you need to be to control it, and how much do you want to spend? Many factors, such as the<br>size and length of the line, size, type and number of blocks needed, and the weight of the boom and everything attached to it (sail,<br>fittings, etc.), can add to the cost and complexity of the installation. The best way, I think, to determine what you need, or want, is to<br>sail on boats with the various rigging options and decide what might work best for you and your boat based on that experience. Of<br>course, another alternative is to just sit in someone else’s cockpit sipping on a Tanqueray and tonic, and quizzing the host on his or her<br>preference of rig. This method too, has its drawbacks, but it can be great fun!<br></p>
