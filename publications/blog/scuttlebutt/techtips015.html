            <p>Tech Tip #16<br><br>Written by Vice Commodore Bill Whitney<br><br>During the last several months I’ve had the opportunity to witness a few vessel surveys and overhear the surveyor’s comments<br>as they went through the major systems of the boats. It got me thinking about some of the things I’ve seen over the years but never<br>completely considered the ramifications of what I saw. One of these is the way we connect the thru-hulls and seacocks to the systems<br>inside the boat. Maybe its self-preservation or just that I’m a cheap Yankee but I don’t like holes in my boat. They let the water outside<br>become water inside unless you spend a lot of money putting the right stuff in the holes. Thru-hulls, seacocks, nipples, hoses, packing<br>glands, dripless seals and in some cases rudder seals are the more common things you find plugging the holes in your boat. You could<br>also have the occasional wooden plug or bung, but hopefully not many of them.<br><br>The principle concerns voiced during many surveys center around basic safety (as it should), mixed metals, and poor design<br>layout of many of these thru-hull and seacock installations. I was surprised to discover a few problems with my own boat over the<br>years but these were minor and I suspect added during “upgrades” to the boat. And I have to admit, some of them were installed by me.<br><br>As I was preparing this article my Jan.2012 issue of WoodenBoat magazine arrived in the mail and I was glad to see the piece<br>that Steve D’ Antonio did on seacocks and thru-hulls. It is a very good read and on a subject that everyone with a boat should review.<br>The essence of the article is that, just because the seacocks or thru-hulls are already installed in your boat it may not be done<br>“correctly” or with the right materials. I put “correctly” in quotes because there are no steadfast rules<br>governing recreational craft as there are with government mil-spec or commercial craft. The ABYC<br>(American Boat and Yacht Council) has widely accepted standards for pleasure craft, but there are<br>no “boat police” to enforce these standards. And many of our boats were built well before the<br>ABYC, or their standards, even existed! So while the boat is laid up, and as you go thru her greasing<br>the seacocks, it may be prudent to look over their installation and see if anything needs to be done to<br>avoid letting the water outside from becoming the water inside.<br><br>The ABYC standards recommend seacocks, such as the one pictured on the right, on any<br>fitting penetrating the hull that may be submerged when the vessel is heeled under maximum design<br>load. Since our Friendships sail with the rail at or under water on a stiff beam reach, it follows that<br>nearly all the thru-hulls should have seacocks. Guess what! My cockpit drains, which are submerged<br>even at the mooring, had no valves until I installed them about 15 years ago. From what I’ve seen on<br>other Dictator and Pemaquid glass hulls I'll bet there are more thru-hulls out there with no seacocks.<br><br>A sampling of some of these “less than ideal” installations occurred last year when a<br>recently purchased Pemaquid came to the yard and the new owner started going through the boat,<br>correcting these problems. On his boat there were no seacocks fitted on the cockpit scupper thru-<br>hulls; instead gate valves were used, the kind with the round blue handles you see on household<br>garden hoses. Inasmuch as the thru-hull mushroom has straight threads as shown in the picture, and<br>the gate valve has tapered pipe threads, there was only about 2 turns of thread holding back the<br>ocean. Gate valves, of course are a no go for boats as you cannot see if it is open or closed and it<br>could get stuck open with something blocking the gate closure.<br><br>The bilge pump was attached to the port cockpit scupper thru-hull with some brass nipples<br>and bronze street fittings. There was no vented loop (or any loop for that matter) in the bilge hose —<br>it ran straight downhill to the bilge. The only thing keeping the<br>submerged scupper thru-hull from siphoning the ocean in was the<br>backflow preventer at the pump. A piece of dirt, hair, lint or the run-away lime pulp from your last gin<br>and tonic stuck in the valve of the backflow preventer could result in a sinking.<br><br>Another common problem is the seacock-to-hose connection. On the Pemaquid there was a<br>complete lack of “pipe to hose connectors”, i.e. a fitting with a male threaded end and a hose barb end.<br>Instead every hose seemed to be fastened to the threaded end of a pipe with a single hose clamp, which<br>was all that the limited surface area allowed. In some cases the threaded pipe was not bronze pipe, but<br>brass. In many cases the pipe is not threaded where the hose is attached which doesn’t give the hose<br>much of a surface to grip.<br><br>Although not in the same safety category as a thru-hull, I ran into this same problem with my raw<br>water pump. The input and output connections were smooth pipe. Thankfully they were long enough<br>to position two hose clamps on the hose over the solid surface of the pipe to get a good seal. But it would not have taken much back-<br>pressure to blow the hose off the smooth pipe. There was also a mix of metals; stainless on one end and bronze on the other. Not a<br>show stopper, but I would rather see bronze hose barb fittings on both ends. Hose barbs are superior to threaded fittings because the<br>threads cut the interior surface of the hose, especially when compressed by a clamp.<br><br>On the Pemaquid, the cockpit scupper drains in the aft end of the cockpit on both sides had street connection fittings fiber<br><br>glassed into the sole, and the threaded end was used for the hose<br>connection. The reinforcement wires in the hose were rusted<br>from the bronze threads cutting into the hose. A simple twist of<br>the hose resulted in the hose just tearing away. The other end, at<br>the gate valves, also had the hoses connected to male pipe<br>threads.<br><br>As with most boats, these fittings are buried deep in the<br>aft lockers or under floorboards and are not very accessible,<br>either for inspection or for servicing. In this case, the bilge pump<br>hose was connected to a male pipe thread at the port cockpit<br>scupper thru-hull under the quarter berth. You have to ask<br>yourself: “How accessible are these valves if something happens<br>and they need to be closed?” Does your storage plan allow you<br>to get to all your valves? Do you have tapered wooden plugs to<br>drive into a broken thru-hull or fitting that fails?<br><br>The engine cooling water seacock had a street fitting on<br>it and the Groco seawater strainer had a brass nipple inserted<br>with the result of having two male threaded ends to which the<br>hose was connected. The raw water hose at the exhaust elbow<br>was the wrong type of hose. Someone had installed soft, unrein-<br>forced, rubber automotive hose that was kinked because it could<br>not sustain the bend required. A 90 degree pipe to hose connec-<br>tor would provide a better hose path.<br><br>The fuel filling hose was attached to a male threaded<br>fitting at the tank with the result that the seal was not tight,<br>allowing fuel to leak out of the hose/thread joint.<br><br>Another common problem, as pointed out in the<br>WoodenBoat article, is the stress that can be put on the seacocks<br>and thru-hulls by any tight radius hose bends or heavy pipe that<br>are attached to them. Ideally you should only use seacocks. They<br>have wide bases that support the mass of the valve and distribute<br>the load imposed by hoses. Thru-hulls with separate valves<br>attached to them have to rely on the mushroom head and backing<br>nut to support the side load imposed by hoses or other pipe<br>fittings attached to them. Either can be used, but carefully assess<br>the installation to see if any excessive side loads will be present.<br><br>Care also has to be taken when storing gear and equip-<br>ment to prevent damage to your seacocks and thru-hulls. A 30<br>pound anchor sliding across the stern locker can do a lot of<br>damage! Plan your storage and secure any heavy loads so they<br>can’t move around in a heavy sea.<br><br>Hamilton Marine and Jamestown Distributors have a<br>good stock of these seacocks and barbed tail pieces. So if you<br>find that your installation leaves something to be desired, now<br>might be the best time to upgrade.<br><br>Note: Special thanks to Bill Lundquist for providing<br><br>input to this article.<br></p>
