            <p>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical<br>experience accumulated by our membership and not just my<br>favorite boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place<br>where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either<br>obtain direct answers in this column or direction to appropriate<br>reference material.<br><br>Well “popular demand’ struck again I’m happy to say, so<br>we'll depart from the originally planned series of articles and<br>respond to a request for some maintenance / repair advise.<br>Before proceeding though, I have to admit that what you are<br>about to read is based only on my limited experience. I am not a<br>professional boat builder, nor am 1 in the boat repair business.<br>But aside from the legal disclaimers, I have been messing<br>around with boats for 35 years and during that time needed to<br>repair a lot of different things myself (due primarily to lack of<br>cash). If any of the pros that read this want to comment,<br>please...please, let’s hear from you!<br><br>So here it is springtime, a very rainy spring at that, and a<br>reader asked a question about leaks in the cabin top, especially<br>around the companionway hatch. Well as luck has it, two years<br>ago this was my problem as well. It was discovered during a<br>real downpour while sitting at our mooring. It was just a drip.<br>Nothing to get excited about. Just one of those really annoying<br>splat...splat...splat noises that overpowers your concentration<br>when you are trying to read a really great sea story on a dark<br>rainy night. The only good part of this leak was that it wasn’t<br>right over my berth.<br><br>So putting the book down, troubleshooting started! There<br>wasn’t much wind that night, so the water couldn’t have been<br>blown in past the baffles under the hatch. Further investigation<br>revealed that pressing on the trim piece at the forward side of<br>the hatch opening forced water to squeeze out. The only way<br>the water could get there was to come in under the hatch rail. If<br>that was the case, the water was also getting into the wood<br>cabin top. I don’t know how long it had been going on, but I<br>suddenly saw my biodegradable boat rotting out from under<br>(over?) me as I slept.<br><br>The construction of the cabin tops on our Friendships is as<br>varied as the boats themselves. Wood (of course), laminated<br>plywood, laminated plywood sheathed in fiberglass, solid fiber-<br>glass, and cored fiberglass (usually with balsa) are some of the<br>construction methods that are used. Leaks in any type of<br>construction require at least minimum inspection to see what<br>the total extent of the damage or deterioration might be and<br>locate the source of the leak. My boat’s cabin top is fiberglass-<br>sheathed plywood, but before we get into my story, let’s review<br>a selection of the initial actions that should or could occur.<br><br>1. Localize the source of the water intrusion as best you can.<br>This step can be the hardest because water can migrate a<br>considerable distance before it drips or runs down the<br>headliner.<br><br>2. If it’s a small leak get a thumbtack and piece of string. If<br>the leak is larger, get a long towel or even a long section of<br><br>paper towel. Stick the thumbtack into the wood as close to<br>the leak as possible, and put the end of the string or towel<br>into a bucket. The water will run down the string or towel<br>and quietly deposit itself in the bucket.<br><br>3. Now go back to sleep or reading your book. You have done<br>all that you can do until daylight, and you won't have to<br>listen to.... splat....splat....splat anymore.<br><br>4. Oh yes, remember where the bucket is so you don’t step<br>into it in the morning.<br><br>When daylight comes you have several alternatives. Which<br>one you choose depends on several things; boat construction,<br>size of the leak, size of your wallet, level of patience, etc. Going<br>from complex (expensive but thorough) to easy (quick but<br>hazardous to the long term health of your boat), here are the<br>choices as I see them.<br><br>A. Complete disassembly of the companionway trim and<br>framing and inspection of the area for deterioration.<br>Radical surgery!<br><br>B. Localized disassembly of the structure in the leak area<br>and a limited inspection. A measured approach.<br><br>C. Caulk the area of the leak and hope there is no hidden<br>damage. The ostrich approach.<br><br>Whatever the case, you should not ignore it. You may choose<br>to have someone else fix it if the alternatives are either “A” or<br>“B”, but I would at least give it a good inspection.<br><br>The decisions you make are based on what you find during<br>the inspection and many of the factors I joked about above. but 1<br>think the basis of the decision is driven by the construction of<br>the cabin top and your basic skills.<br><br>With a solid fiberglass cabin top you can probably get away<br>with choice “C” since fiberglass has a real high rot resistance.<br>However, if the boat has wooden rails you may want to remove<br>and re-bed them so the rails themselves don’t rot. This repair<br>should be well within anyone’s capability.<br><br>At the opposite end of the spectrum, the cored fiberglass<br>construction might require very detailed inspection that can<br>only be accomplished if you disassemble all of the companion-<br>way trim so you can see what’s behind it. If the folks who made<br>the boat didn’t seal the core completely when they were cutting<br>the cabin top to fit the companionway, you have a problem. The<br>reason for this radical surgery is the fact that any water that<br>leaks into the sandwich is trapped. It soaks into the core<br>material and if the material is wood, such as balsa, it rots. A<br>rotten core significantly reduces the structural strength of<br>sandwich construction. Fixing a large section of damaged cabin<br>top that’s made with cored construction is better left to a pro. It<br>involves cutting out the interior surface and exposing the core<br>so you can rip out the bad core material and laminate new<br>material into the void.<br><br>Diagnosing the extent of the damage can be accomplished<br>with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Obviously the primary<br>diagnostic tool is your eyes. Visual inspection will usually give<br><br>(Continued to Page 7)<br><br>je<br>you many clues on where a leak is and the extent of the<br>damage. Hidden damage requires a different troubleshooting<br>method. I like to use sound, like sonar, to hear the differences<br>in material density of the wood or whatever is under the fiber-<br>glass. Good solid wood sounds like ...well...g00d solid wood.<br>When you hit it, it goes thump. No hollowness, no echo, just a<br>deep base tone. Rot eats the lignin in the wood leaving voids in<br>the wood’s structure. When you hit it, it sounds hollow. Its’ one<br>of those things that when you hear it, you'll know! The best<br>way to familiarize yourself with the sound is to start tapping on<br>good wood and work your way toward a known rotten section. I<br>used a small leather mallet because it won’t damage the surface,<br>but you can use almost anything. Just remember that the<br>hammer may cause more damage than you want, so tap<br>judiciously.<br><br>Another way you can locate the damage in a non-cored cabin<br>top is to remove the headliner and do a visual inspection. If the<br>damage is extensive, it will be obvious. You'll probably pull<br>pieces of the wood or plywood off with the headliner. Less<br>extensive damage can be difficult to locate. One of the telltales<br>will be the stain that the water leaves on the surface of the<br>wood. After repeated wet / dry cycles a residue that contains the<br>breakdown byproducts forms on the surface. Probing the area<br>with a small penknife or ice pick will usually show you where<br>the weak / rotten areas are located. Plywood can be a little<br>tricky. Because of its’ layered construction, water and rot can<br>migrate down one layer yet leave the other layers untouched.<br>Tapping will usually work, but you may need to take core<br>samples to really home in on the problem.<br><br>Since I had fiberglass-sheathed plywood, and very little exter-<br>nal evidence of water intrusion, I used two methods to locate<br>the extent of my problem; sounding with the leather mallet and<br>drilled core samples. First I tapped....tapped....tapped on the<br>fiberglass sheath on the outside of the top. Using the differences<br>in the sound I outlined the suspect area which was about the<br>size of an 8 % X 11 piece of paper. I marked the area off with a<br>pencil. Then J took a thin-walled plug cutter and cut a hole into<br>the underside of the top near the point where it was leaking.<br>The hole was just deep enough to get a good wood sample but<br>not deep enough the cut through the fiberglass. This first<br>sample showed me that wood was not rotten, so I took three<br>additional samples. One was about 6 in. from the first, and<br>again showed no rot. The last two were taken in the center of<br>the area I mapped and again about 6-in. apart. The conclusion<br>of all this probing was that my problem was delamination, not<br>rot. Evidently there was just enough flexing of the delaminated<br>section so that when I walked on the cabin top the slight<br>movement broke the seal of the bedding compound under the<br>hatch rail allowing it to leak. It hadn’t been leaking for long<br>and there was no indication of moisture in the samples.<br><br>Now the issue was how to repair it. For this I went to the<br>Gougeon Brothers “West System” epoxy repair book. In it they<br>outline a procedure where you drill a pattern of small holes in<br>the top of the cabin, about an inch or two apart, that will accept<br>the tip of a small syringe. But the first things that had to be<br>fixed were the holes cut with the plug cutter on the inside of the<br>cabin. Luckily the holes took the next plug size up, so armed<br>with a little thickened epoxy they were set home and allowed to<br>dry. Next, a thinned mix of epoxy was injected into each hole of<br>the pattern that covered the area I had mapped while trouble-<br>shooting. The trick is to fit the tip of the syringe tightly into the<br>lowest hole and inject enough epoxy so it oozes out of the holes<br>above it or beside it. When it’s full of epoxy, put a match stick<br>or wood plug in the hole so the epoxy doesn’t run out.<br><br>The epoxy was left over the next week to setup. Finishing the<br>repair was fairly straightforward. The process of sanding,<br>filling, fairing, sanding, filling, and final fairing; followed by<br>priming and painting, and painting took the next two<br>weekends. The job came out pretty good, in spite of my amateur<br>status. The best part is that the leak hasn’t returned. | could<br>have had the boat yard do the job, but I always subscribe to the<br>philosophy that if I pay someone else to do the job, I’ve lost<br>twice; once when I paid them the money, and again because I<br>lost the opportunity to learn something.<br><br>SS<br></p>
