            <p>Tech Tips<br>by Old_Salt<br><br>During recent meetings and gatherings we've been asking your<br>opinion on ways to broaden the appeal for this newsletter. Several<br>folks have suggested that articles on various marine systems or boat<br>maintenance may be beneficial. Hopefully, this column will be a<br>forum for sharing the vast range of practical experience accumulated<br>by our membership. It is also intended to be the place where you, the<br>reader, can submit technical questions and either obtain answers or<br>direction to appropriate reference material.<br><br>Since the flood of letters and e-mail has been so magnificently<br>underwhelming in response to previous articles I can safely assume<br>either of two scenarios. One, you loved it but are too embarrassed to<br>ask questions: or two, you haven't understood a word I wrote. In either<br>case I can safely continue my assault on the six chosen topics without<br>fear of criticism or revocation of my membership. In case you don't<br>remember, the topics are; electrical wiring, alternators and regulators,<br>batteries, grounding and bonding. radios and antennas, and instrumen-<br>tation (depth, speed, GPS, LORAN, etc.).<br><br>The previous articles covered wire and connections that comprise the<br>electrical power delivery system of a boat. But what produces the<br>power? Since Friendships spend most of their time away from a pier<br>and power receptacle, itâ€™s a safe bet that most of our electrical power<br><br>production comes from the engine driven alternator. I don't know if<br>there are any boats out there with 12vdc generators, but for the sake of<br><br>brevity I'm not going to get into them. If you have one and have any<br>questions give me a call, or e-mail me at old_salt@ix.netcom.com.<br><br>Most of the problems I've encountered with marine alternators were<br>caused by replacement of the original alternator with the wrong part,<br>or gradual "consumption creep" that overpowers the existing one. The<br>scenarios are quite different, but the results are the same....an unsatis-<br>factory and potentially unsafe electrical system.<br><br>As delivered from the factory and installed on a boat the alternator<br>installation was probably well done. However, years of operation in a<br>marine environment eventually take their toll forcing its replacement<br>or addition of power hungry navigation equipment (i.e. the 12-volt<br>blender for the Margaritas) gradually forces recharging the batteries<br>more often. In the either case adding a high output alternator to the<br>electrical system is a good idea. The trick is to do the installation<br>correctly<br><br>If you have a gasoline engine you have to make sure that the replace-<br>ment unit is certified for "MARINE" use. Units so certified have<br>internal screens and shielded brush assemblies that greatly reduce the<br>potential for ignition of gasoline vapors. Additionally, sealed bearings<br>are normally employed to keep salt moisture out. But buyer beware!<br>Even though you have the original part number it may be wrong and<br>not for a MARINE grade item. The engines used in boats are usually<br>available in several configurations, many of which are industrial... not<br>marine. Another problem is that an alternate or substitute part number<br>for the original may be called out in the parts catalog and it may not be<br>"MARINE" grade alternator. Check it out carefully or have a marine<br>mechanic/electrician inspect it for you:<br><br>Replacement alternators usually don't have pulleys installed on the<br>shaft when taken out of the box. This is good! It forces you to use the<br>original pulley that is more than likely sized correctly. Since the<br>pulley on the engine that drives the alternator is bigger than the alter-<br>nator pulley, the alternator rotor spins faster than the engine. For<br>instance, if the engine crankshaft pulley is 8" in diameter and it is<br>turning at 1,000 RPM, a 4" pulley on the alternator will turn the rotor<br>at 2.000 RPM. The speed ratio is inversely proportional to the pulley<br>diameter. A modern alternator needs to spin at 5,000 RPM to produce<br>its rated output. If your engine RPM for normal cruising is 3,000<br><br>RPM the alternator is only turning at 6,000 RPM, just above the speed<br>it needs to produce its rated output. Higher RPM certainly won't hurt<br>it. They can safely operate at rotor speeds in the 10,000 RPM range.<br><br>Gasoline fueled engines normally operate in higher RPM ranges<br>than diesels. If you have diesel power, the alternator pulley's size is<br>more critical than in a gasoline engine installation. Because of the<br>lower engine RPM range involved the pulley on an alternator used<br>with a diesel engine will normally be smaller than one used on a gas<br>engine. If we use the same pulley sizes as in the previous example, 8"<br>crankshaft and 4" alternator rotor pulleys, and use a normal diesel's<br>cruising speed of 2,000 RPM, the alternator is only spinning at 4,000<br>RPM. Well below the speed needed to reach its rated output. In<br>diesel applications size really matters! And unlike most things in life,<br>smaller is better.<br><br>One of the problems I see on older boats directly relates to pulley<br>size. In an attempt to maintain our reputation as frugal Yankees we<br>replace the ancient, rusty, burned-out alternator off the beloved<br>behemoth below decks with one from the old Chevy out behind the<br>barn. The wiring isn't that tough to figure out and the "idiot light" on<br>the engine panel goes out when the engine is up to speed. The voltme-<br>ter even reads 12 VDC. But the darn thing just won't keep the batter-<br>ies charged. The reason is that the alternator isn't spinning fast<br>enough to produce the current needed to recharge the batteries. The<br>boat's engine, being a diesel, won't tun the Chevy's (gasoline powered<br>engine) alternator fast enough because no one thought to change the<br>pulley.<br><br>Here's a good way to check the alternator installation. Before you<br>start it up, measure the voltage across the starting battery with a<br>digital meter. You can use an analog meter but be aware that the<br>change in the voltage reading is fairly small and may not be easy to<br>read on an analog scale. A new, fully charged battery should read<br>about 13.7 VDC, but the actual value isn't that important for this test,<br>just remember what the value was. While holding the meter leads<br>across the battery terminals, have some one start the engine. The<br>voltage will drop while the engine is being cranked. This is normal<br>When the engine starts and you release the starter motor the voltage<br>across the battery should increase, up to the original value that you<br>read before you started it, then slowly beyond that value to about 14.2<br>VDC or greater. At an idle (600 - 800 RPM) the alternator should be<br>able to maintain an output voltage of about 14.2 VDC across the<br>battery.<br><br>If your results are somewhat less than these, you more than likely<br>have a problem somewhere in the charging system. A good place to<br>start troubleshooting it would be to measure the diameter of the<br>pulleys and calculate the RPM of the alternator. If it isn't in the 1800 -<br>2400 RPM range while the engine is idling it may not have the right<br>size pulley. The best way to determine the minimum RPM for the<br>alternator is to check out the manufacturer's technical data sheet (if<br>you can get a copy). The next best thing is to install an ammeter in<br>series with the battery output and actually measure the charging<br>current going to the battery under varying engine speeds. The<br>ammeter should always read slightly above zero or a greater positive<br>value. It should never read a negative (discharge) value with a good<br>alternator and regulator.<br><br>There are several sources of alternators if you need to purchase one.<br>Boat US, West Marine and J.C. Whitney are good mail order sources.<br>The West Marine Master Catalog also has a very informative Advisor<br>section on how to choose alternators and regulators. The last J.C.<br>Whitney catalog | received listed a marine alternator in their marine<br>section that was very reasonably priced when compared with West and<br>Boat US. If you are thinking of upgrading your alternator I highly<br>recommend getting an externally regulated model. But more on that<br>subject in the next article.<br></p>
