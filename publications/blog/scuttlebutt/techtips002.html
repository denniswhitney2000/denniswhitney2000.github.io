            <p>During recent mectings and gatherings we've been asking your<br>opinion on ways to broaden the appeal for this newsletter.<br>Several folks have suggested that articles on various marine<br>systems or boat maintenance may be beneficial. Hopefully, this<br>column will be a forum for sharing the vast range of practical<br>experience accumulated by our membership. It is also intended<br>to be the place where you, the reader, can submit technical<br>questions and cither obtain answers or direction to appropriate<br>reference material.<br><br>As I mentioned in the first "Tech Tips" article, I hope to<br>present six topics related to marine electrical systems. These<br>are: electrical wiring, alternators and regulators, batteries,<br>grounding and bonding, radios and antennas, and instrumenta-<br>tion (depth, speed, GPS, LORAN, etc.). In the last article we<br>talked a lot about marine electrical wiring, but because I got a<br>little long winded, we never covered the various methods for<br>connecting the wires to anything. So in this "about a page"<br>long article we'll look at the connectors, terminals and battery<br>clamps that let the electricity get where we want it to go.<br><br>There are all sorts of ways to connect wires together or to<br>electrical devices. Most of us have seen really great examples<br>of the wrong way to make these connections. Funny thing is<br>that you always find them on other peoples boats. They range<br>from the wires that are jammed between the battery post and<br>battery clamps, to the mega-bundle of wire that's twisted<br>together and held by single (and usually loose) wire nut.<br>Admittedly, this is an extreme example, but hopefully you get<br>the point. Doing things the wrong way sets you up for a<br>"Murphy's Law" calamity.<br><br>The last article pointed out the right way to lay out a wiring<br>system and chose the correct size circuit breakers, fuses and<br>wire. This time we'll look at the right way to fasten things<br>together. If we have everything sized correctly, we can deliver<br>the electrical current from the source to the load devices with<br>very little voltage drop. However, we can only do this if we<br>have everything connected with the appropriate size and type of<br>wire terminals and connectors.<br><br>Usually the largest wire "terminals" used on a boat are the<br>clamps at the ends of the starting battery cables. We don't give<br>them a whole lot of thought until something doesn't work.<br>That's usually the starter motor. And according to Murphy, it<br>usually happens just when you need it most. The clamps must<br>be capable of conducting high current to the starter with a<br>minimum of voltage loss. The amount of contact area between<br>the surface of the clamp and surface of the battery post is criti-<br>cal to the voltage drop (loss) across the connection under high<br>current conditions. If the surfaces are dirty or the clamp is<br>loose, the contact area between the clamp and post is reduced.<br>The lack of surface area causes a resistance to the flow of<br>current. As the starter current increases, more and more<br>voltage is dropped across the bad connection. This represents a<br>power loss since power is equal to current times voltage (P=IE).<br>Under high current conditions the power available at the starter<br><br>won't be great enough to crank the engine fast enough to start<br>it.<br><br>The best way to keep this "Murphy's Law" scenario from<br>happening is to keep the battery connections clean, tight, and<br>protected from corrosion and dirt. After tightening the clamp<br>coat it with some of the products designed for protecting battery<br>connections. You can find them in any chandlery or auto parts<br>store. Do not use greases or light oil-based corrosion preven-<br>tive compounds. These products can penetrate the area between<br>the clamp and battery post, and decrease the contact area. They<br>can even cause a cascade effect, potentially leading to a fire or<br>explosion. I witnessed a fire on a boat that was caused by<br>ignition of the grease used to "protect" the battery terminals.<br>Continuous cranking of a stubborn dicsel caused a poorly<br>connected clamp to overheat enough to melt the grease. The<br>grease burst into flame and ignited the hydrogen gas being<br>produced by the battery. It was not a pretty sight.<br><br>On a far smaller scale, the type of terminals and connectors<br>that you use on other wires on the boat and the method you use<br>to install them can be the difference between a great system and<br>one that causes you continual grief. In an ideal world, all wires<br>run directly from the electrical source to the load device with no<br>connections except for the necessary circuit breakers and fuses.<br>Ok, but how do you attach them! Personally, I like to use ring<br>terminal lugs in combination with terminal strips where appro-<br>priate.<br><br>Ring lugs have the advantage of not falling off the screw they<br>are attached to if it loosens up for any reason. If the device or<br>terminal strip you are attaching them to is in an awkward<br>position they can be hard to attach, but the safety factor of not<br>having electrically hot wires hanging loose greatly offsets this<br>inconvenience.<br><br>All sorts of ring terminals, or lugs, are available. I like to use<br>the type that crimp onto the wire with a crimping tool and have<br>an insulating vinyl sleeve over the barrel that the wire slips<br>into. On the better made lugs the insulation is tapered on the<br>inside so that the multi-strand wire slips right into the hole.<br>These provide a good mechanical and electrical connection<br>between the wire and the lug if you choose the right size. No<br>matter what type connector you use make sure that you get the<br>size that matches the wire's size. If you don't, the crimping tool<br>will distort the barrel end of the connector. Although you may<br>have succeeded in getting the lug mechanically fastened to the<br>wire, you more than likely don't have the correct electrical<br>contact area between the lug and wire. Using the wrong size<br>crimping tool or a pair of pliers to crimp the lug will create the<br>same effect. Combine this poor connection with a little dirt and<br>salt corrosion and you have a good source for future problems.<br><br>The insulating vinyl sleeves on the lugs are usually color<br>coded to match the colored dots on the crimping tools and the<br>size of the wire for which they are designed. Red colored lugs<br>are made to go on 22 -18 gauge (AWG) wire. Blue coded lugs<br><br>(Continued to Page 9)<br>are for 16 - 14 gauge wire. Yellow coded lugs are designed for<br>12-10 gauge wire. Better quality crimping tools have the termi-<br>nal size labeled right next to the machined crimp face. In many<br>cases, they also have a colored dot corresponding to the color<br>code for the lug. These color codes also apply to the in-line<br>splice connectors and other types of terminals. You don't have<br>to be a rocket scientist to do the job correctly.<br><br>In general, avoid using spade lugs or bullet terminals if you<br>can. I avoid them because they can be pulled apart too easily.<br>Of course, in some applications that's what you want, but<br>inspect them routinely if you have to use them. This type of<br>connector uses the spring tension of the outer shell to hold the<br>inner part in place. In a marine environment, they seem to be<br>more prone to corrosion and rapid deterioration. A ring termi-<br>nator screwed to a terminal strip provides a better electrical and<br>mechanical connection that is relatively easy to clean.<br><br>To establish a good electrical connection I always use tinned<br>copper lugs and solder the wire to the lug after it's been<br>crimped. This may seem like overkill (and in anything other<br>than a marine environment it would be) but after several years,<br>corrosion between the wire and lug can become a problem.<br>Careful soldering not only prevents this from happening but<br>also establishes a superb electrical connection between the lug<br>and wire. If you are careful, quick, and have the right heating<br>element on the soldering iron, you can melt the solder to the<br>wire and lug without melting the vinyl insulation. If you<br>haven't had a good conversation with your soldering iron lately.<br>forget you read this paragraph and go buy a good crimping tool!<br>Properly crimped and insulated lugs will last a long time<br><br>Speaking of insulation, you can get lugs and line splices that<br>come with heat shrinkable insulating sleeves. They form a<br>good moisture seal between the insulating sleeve and wire<br>insulation when heated with a heat gun or hair dryer. The seal<br>will keep the salt corrosion at bay as long as it is not disturbed.<br>You can also use products like "Liquid Lectra Tape" or other<br>brush-able insulating material to seal up the insulation. Again.<br>you don't have to go to this extreme, but may want to consider it<br>if the terminals could be exposed to salt spray.<br><br>Another good idea, that should be part of your annual mainte-<br>nance, is to spray all of the electrical terminals, except the<br>batteries, with an anti-corrosive spray that is designed for<br>electrical connections. There are many, many products to<br>choose from. "Practical Sailor" ran an article not too long ago<br>on the subject of corrosion preventive products. I like to use<br>CRC and Boshield. both of which fared well in the "Practical<br>Sailor" comparison tests. As I pointed out earlier there are<br>many excellent references on the subject of marine electrical<br>systems. "The 12 Volt Bible", "Boatowners Illustrated<br>Handbook of Wiring", and other books are available from most<br>good chandlers and catalogs. Gordon West's articles in "Sail<br>Magazine" are excellent references, and well worth reading.<br>“Practical Sailor" has a good article on electrical wire crimpers<br>on page 24 of the June '98 issue.<br>Hopefully this "about a page" long article has stirred up some<br>questions. Certainly your electrical system should not be<br>viewed as a "monster". With a little knowledge and occasional<br>tender loving care you can easily tame it and save yourself some<br>money in repair bills.<br></p>
