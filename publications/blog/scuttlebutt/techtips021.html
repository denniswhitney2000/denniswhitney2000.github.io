            <p>The Mighty Staysail<br><br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>Looking at the typical 20 — 40 foot sloop-rigged<br>production sailboats built from the 1960’s to the 80’s, there are<br>very few rigged with staysails. Almost all of them employed<br>big, overlapping genoa jibs to provide the sail power needed to<br>drive their hulls. Larger schooners and world cruisers<br>employed staysails but these faded from popularity as produc-<br>tion boats. Now, decades later, we see a resurgence of the<br>staysail, not only in new boats, but also in many refits of older<br>production boats, as people discover the limitations of the<br>single headsail rig. Heading upwind in a building breeze with a<br>big genoa, even if it can be efficiently roller-reefed, becomes a<br>challenge. Too much sail overpowers the boat and reefing a<br>large jib upsets the balance of the sail plan by shifting the<br>center of effort too far forward.<br><br>Designers and builders are now producing boats with<br>either permanent or removable inner stays attached to the mast,<br>with the inner triangle about 2/3 of the foretriangle area.<br>Conveniently, this is about the same sail area as a reefed/furled<br>jib. With a sail on the inner stay, the center of effort is moved<br>aft, and provides much better balance for the entire sail plan.<br>On a Friendship sloop, this inner stay is attached to the mast at<br>the same place as the shrouds, and approximately at the center<br>of horizontal thrust for the reefed mainsail, thus providing a<br>strong, mechanically balanced structure. It’s amazing that it<br>only took modern designers 50-plus years to “discover” the<br>staysail again!<br><br>The staysail is a handy and versatile sail, almost effort-<br>less to tack or jibe, and easy to set or strike from the cockpit if<br>properly rigged. This small headsail generates considerable<br>power on its own, and trimmed correctly, augments the<br>mainsail, amplifies the jib, and balances the center of effort on<br>many points of sail.<br><br>A clubfooted staysail has its foot secured to a boom,<br>hence the name “club” commonly given to that spar. Its foot<br>can be attached to the club with lacing, but more commonly it’s<br>‘loose-footed’, attached only at its tack and clew. I have a short<br>lanyard attached to the clew as an outhaul so I can give the sail<br>minor adjustments for wind conditions. In light winds I slack<br>off the outhaul to give the sail a little more curvature, or draft,<br>and I tighten it up to flatten the sail as the wind increases.<br><br>Another alternative rig is to install roller furling, which<br>offers an easy way to deploy, furl, and stow a staysail from the<br>cockpit, and with some set-ups, a way to reduce sail area by<br>partially furling, or roller-reefing. If the sailcloth is robust<br>enough for heavy weather, and the sail is adequately protected<br>from sun exposure when furled, a furling staysail may be a<br>viable option.<br><br>In heavy weather, the staysail becomes the ‘go-to’<br>foresail, providing just the right amount of sail area and<br>maintaining the same balanced center of effort under a double-<br>reefed main as exists with the full rig. Back-luffing it can also<br>be a big help getting on the right tack when sailing off the<br>anchor or mooring, and when coming about in heavy seas. The<br>staysail is at its best on any points of sail between a close reach<br>and a broad reach, and the self-tending ability of the club-<br>footed staysail is very useful in short tacking and<br>single-handing.<br><br>Like all other sails, however, staysails have some<br>limitations, wind range and points of sail to mention a few.<br>When sailing downwind on a very broad reach, the staysail can<br>interfere with the airflow to the jib, due both to the weight of<br>the club, and the partial blanketing by the mainsail. I find that<br>dropping the staysail can actually increase boat speed, as the<br>full jib moves the center of effort forward to counteract the<br>tendency of the boat to round up. Similarly, on a dead run, a<br>preventer or whisker pole which keeps the club ‘winged’ out on<br>the opposite side from the mainsail, prevents the staysail from<br>collapsing. The staysail and club can become a weapon during<br>an accidental jibe. Clubs tend to dominate the foredeck, and<br>can interfere with anchoring, keeping a bow watch on a foggy<br>day, or storing a dinghy.<br><br>The design elements your sailmaker has to consider<br>are the area and normal wind range in which you will be<br>sailing, proximity to the mast and other sails, amount of inner<br>stay sag on various points of sail, and desired location of the<br>center of effort for the sail relative to the overall sail plan. One<br>of the issues I have with my staysail is how much it disturbs the<br>luff of the mainsail when close-hauled. The windward perform-<br>ance would likely improve with a smaller staysail, or by having<br>my existing sail recut with some hollow added to the leach. If<br>the staysail is too full, or the slot between leech and mainsail is<br>too tight (because of poor sail trim or shape), it will disturb the<br>airflow and efficiency of both the jib and the mainsail, particu-<br>larly when sailing close-hauled.<br><br>Since the staysail often doubles as the heavy weather<br>sail, robustness all around is imperative. The most failsafe<br>staysail arrangement is a hanked-on, loose-footed sail that’s<br>stoutly constructed and that’s sized and shaped conservatively.<br>Its fabric weight should be equal to or greater than the weight<br>of the mainsail cloth. Its corners should be heavily reinforced<br>with multiple layers of sailcloth, extending along twelve to<br>fifteen percent of the length of the luff, leech, or foot that<br>they’re supporting.<br><br>The corner hardware should be non-corroding bronze<br>or stainless steel, built and installed to take the load of a<br>50-knot gust. Webbing reinforcement may be added to enhance<br>the strength and flexibility of the corner rings. The type of jib<br>hanks and the way they’re secured to the luff of a hanked-on<br>staysail, make a huge difference in the reliability, ease of<br>repairing, and handling of the sail. Jib hanks should be bronze,<br>reusable, and large enough to allow an easy run up and down<br>the stay, with piston pulls all on the same side.<br><br>The venerable, valuable and versatile little staysail<br>adds much to a sailor’s options if it’s built for the task, and the<br>rig it’s flown on is designed to maximize its performance. This<br>headsail that consistently provides yeoman service, proves once<br>again that good things do indeed come in small packages!<br><br>(Note: Much of the content of this article is a distillation of<br>multiple sources, among them, “In Praise of the Versatile<br>Staysail”, by Carol Hasse, “The Sailmaker’s Apprentice” by<br>Emiliano Marino, and “Sails”, by Jeremy Howard-Williams,<br>and of course, YEARS of personal experience)<br></p>
