            <p>Tech Tips: Mildew Problems<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>As we put our boats away for another winter we may notice some of the little ‘issues’ that have accumulated<br>over the season. Although this season may have been shortened, the wear and tear on boats that did get launched and<br>their systems was probably about the same as previous years. Frayed and chafed lines, grass in the sea strainers,<br>wear on the packing glands and mildew on the sails and cushions. For those boats that didn’t make it into the water<br>the subject of this article may also apply due to poor ventilation while covered. This article focuses on the hull<br>interior, fabrics in and on the boat, and how they respond to the normally damp environment within which they exist.<br>Dealing with black spots and boat smells are just as much a part of sailing as bottom painting and other chores we<br>perform to keep our floating treasures in good condition. Searching for products that are effective and inexpensive is<br>always a chore for a “frugal” (cheap) Yankee such as myself. I’m forever trying different things, with varying<br>success.<br><br>Last fall, while volunteering on the Schooner Adventure out of Gloucester, we discovered a mildew<br>problem in the foc’s’l. Luckily another volunteer had a formula consisting of readily available household products<br>that proved to be an excellent remedy. Coincidently this fall Practical Sailor magazine published an article by<br>Darrell Nicholson on mildew and mold treatments, concluding with results that matched what we experienced. What<br>follows is a summary of a dozen or so products tested on various materials both in the lab and on board boats. For<br>more detail on methods and results, we refer you to the full article.<br><br>Twelve products were tested, comprised of gels and solids that work through emitting a vapor, and liquid<br>sprays that work by direct contact, two of which were home-made formulas, as well as household bleach and vinegar.<br>These are listed roughly from most effective to least.<br><br>Goldshield GS 5: This product was a clear winner, earning the Best Choice pick. It is currently available<br>only on the web but the company is working on a wider distribution for the marine market. It is regarded as safe<br>when used as directed and is approved for a wide range of applications.<br><br>Formula A: Combined one quart hot water, one tablespoon baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), two<br>tablespoons washing soda (sodium carbonate), and two tablespoons trisodium phosphate (TSP). This homebrew is<br>cheap. It works. Find your own empty spray bottle and try it.<br><br>Formula B: Combined one quart hot water, two tablespoons baking soda, two tablespoons Borax, and one<br>tablespoon TSP. Without a doubt, this was the cheapest mildew solution, and was very effective.<br><br>3M Marine Mildew Block: Based on the formula, we expect that the water resistance will be superior to<br>Concrobium and the DIY blends. This is a good product for areas exposed to occasional spray.<br><br>Siamon’s Concrobium: This recommended product rated well again, but it was matched by the cheaper,<br>homemade Formula A.<br><br>Household Bleach, 10% solution: Bleach killed mold, removed stains, and greatly reduced reinfection<br>(especially when not rinsed with fresh water). Of course, the sample was bleached, reminding us that it is only<br>suitable for completely color-fast surfaces and materials. Sailors should be aware of bleach’s bad reputation in the<br>marine environment. It is not eco-friendly, but it still has a place in the cleanup arsenal.<br><br>Pur-A-Fy Air: The formula is not cheap, $43 for an 8-ounce tub. It is an expensive air-freshener that has<br>some limited natural mildew-fighting properties and a nice scent.<br><br>Renuzit Super Odor Neutralizer: While it won't kill mold, our test noses approved, and it certainly could<br>make sense as part of a spring cleanup.<br><br>Forespar’s Tea Tree Power Gel: Fine for freshening cabins, but don't expect miracles.<br><br>Forespar’s Tea Tree Oil Spray: Use sparingly for masking odors and perhaps to control some incipient<br><br>mildew.<br><br>Star Brite NosGUARD SG: Rather than relying on NosGUARD, the owner of a used boat is going to be<br>happier if he/she bites the bullet and cleans the boat thoroughly, then concentrates on keeping humidity levels down.<br><br>Plain vinegar: Left to dry, reportedly works on some hard surfaces, however, this sample became more<br>mildewed than the control sample! Not recommended.<br><br>In general, treated Sunbrella fabric samples remained mildew free. All of the other fabric samples<br>developed a few small mildew spots. Vapor emitting gels and solids could not prevent tough infestations, but we<br>found that the pillows and interiors were noticeably fresher smelling after a few weeks of exposure, though the<br>benefit lasted only a few weeks. These products seemed mostly to be masking odors. They might retard mildew<br>growth, and the science supports that, but it’s not enough to make a difference in any significant infestation.<br><br>All of the spray products gave similar coverage, as all are water-based and have the same instructions:<br>Spray from 6 to 10 inches away until the fabric is moist, remove excess, and let sit. Figure on about 100 square feet<br>per quart, and at least double that figure on hard surfaces. While some mildew returned to the control area, the<br>treated areas stayed clean and fresh smelling for six months. None of the products worked well as hull or deck<br>cleaners. They seemed to deteriorate or wash away in the weather and can strip away wax.<br><br>As atule, keeping things dry using dehumidification or ventilation, though not always practical or possible,<br>was far more effective than any product we have tested. Dry should always be the first line of defense, with chemical<br>treatments saved for those areas and items that unavoidably get damp.<br><br>On schooner Adventure we used Formula B by the gallon, spraying it on with a good agricultural sprayer.<br>The results were excellent. All of the mildew was gone the next day. Since then we have rigged fans throughout the<br>hull to keep the air moving and reduce interior humidity, which is a challenge in a large wooden hull.<br></p>
