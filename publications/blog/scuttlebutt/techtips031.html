            <p>Tech Tips #9<br>By "The Old Salt"<br><br>This column is a forum for sharing the vast range of practical experience accumulated by our membership and not just my<br>favorite boat maintenance topics. It is intended to be the place where you, the reader, can ask technical questions and either obtain<br>direct answers in this column or direction to appropriate reference material. Normally at this point I list the past topics and transition<br>into the next planned item. But this time we'll depart from the original plan and, by popular request, review some of the practical tasks<br>that should be part of your winter lay-up routine. As we normally do, I'll focus on the electrical systems, with a little divergence here<br>and there for other interesting tidbits of information.<br><br>For my money the most important electrical lay-up task is the winter maintenance of the batteries. Well cared for, your<br>batteries should last you ten or more years, but that's dependent on many variables such as charging rate, load, depth of discharge, etc.<br>Obviously these are not of major concern if the boat is high and dry on-the-hard. What is important is to remember that even good<br>lead â€”acid batteries will loose some of their charge over the winter. The amount of discharge will depend on their state of charge<br>when they were removed, and their general condition and age.<br><br>For starters the batteries should be taken off the boat, cleaned, topped off with distilled water, and inspected for physical<br>condition. A common failure for run-of-the-mill batteries is separation of the top from the bottom of the casing. Although the<br>separation isn't obvious, a tell-tail sign is the presence of electrolyte just below the top of the battery, and no apparent moisture on the<br>top. If you have this problem you probably have a small pool of battery acid in the bottom of the battery box and low levels of<br>electrolyte in one or more cells. If the battery is still under warranty get rid of it. You don't need the kind of problems that a leaking<br>battery can cause, especially if it is getting into your salt-water bilge.<br><br>Even if they were fully charged (@ 1.275 pH) when you took them off the boat, you need to put them on a charger and<br>verify that your boat's system is, in fact, fully restoring the energy in the batteries. Topping off their charge before setting them in the<br>barn for the next few months will help when you re-commission in the spring. Personally, I don't like the idea of trickle charging<br>because most chargers are not designed for it. Using a regular charger to trickle charge over a long period of time will overcharge the<br>battery, boil off the electrolyte, and damage the battery. A really good, high end charger that's designed for trickle charging will do<br>the job correctly, but most of us don't have one of those hanging around the garage. It is a good idea to put the batteries back on a<br>charger after about three months of inactivity just to top them off, but don't leave them on the charger.<br><br>With the batteries out of the battery box you also have a good opportunity to clean it up and check out how well fastened it<br>is. A rotten base or acid eaten, corroded fastenings won't hold 100 lbs of batteries in place very well. And the worst part is that things<br>like this don't break loose until you are stressing things. Then when things go wrong they have a tendency to compound rapidly. You<br>don't need this kind of excitement ....so check the box and ensure that it won't come adrift too easily.<br><br>When you disconnect the drive belt from the alternator, water pump and crankshaft pulley, grab the pulley on the front of the<br>alternator and give it a spin. It should rotate freely with just a little drag from the commutator brushes. It shouldn't make any bearing<br>noise either, nor have any play, sideways or axially. While you are there, spin the water pump and see if there are any unusual sounds<br>or mechanical play in the bearings that would indicate impending failure.<br><br>While you are at it remember to change the antifreeze, oil and transmission fluids to get the acids and combustion<br>by-products out of the engine block and off the bearing surfaces. Squirting oil into the intake, a practice called fogging, while<br>cranking the engine over (but not starting it) is also a good idea as it lubricates the cylinders and helps to prevent internal, upper<br>cylinder, corrosion. After all this is done seal off the intake and exhaust ports to keep the moist winter air from getting into the engine.<br>This is also the best time to check all the hoses and electrical connections around the engine so you know what is facing you in the<br>spring, or can be added to the winter work list.<br><br>Fogging the engine is a good way to keep corrosion at bay. The engine isn't the only thing that will corrode over the winter.<br>In addition to inspecting the wiring around the engine, take a look at the rest of the boat. Now is a good time to put some corrosion<br>preventive compound on the electrical bus bars, switches and other electrical connections. WD-40 is a good product for displacing<br>moisture in connectors. Kerosene (K1) also works quite well. It also is great for cleaning up your rusty boat tools and soaking paint<br>and varnish brushes between uses.<br><br>Other lay-up chores should include inspection of stuffing boxes, greasing seacocks, and inspecting and lubricating the<br>steering gear. Good luck and have a great winter season<br><br></p>
