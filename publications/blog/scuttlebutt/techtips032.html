            <p>Tech Tips: The Right Brush for the Right Job<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>Boat maintenance requires tools and varying degrees of skill depending on the task to be done. As with<br>most things, there are a wide range of tools and tool types that can be used on any job. Painting and varnishing are<br>no different. Choosing the appropriate brush of the right quality will make all the difference between a job that’s<br>merely done or a job that’s done well.<br><br>Brush choice depends on the brush's job. Will it be applying paint, varnish or bottom paint? The best brush<br>available isn't necessarily the best brush for the project. Inexpensive chip brushes can be just as useful as the $40<br>varnish brush. You wouldn't use a $40 brush that requires meticulous cleaning to paint the bilge or apply bottom<br>paint, just as you wouldn't use a throw-away chip brush to lay a final coat of varnish on the toerail.<br><br>As Don Casey put it in his marine-maintenance bible, "This Old Boat", “Varnish will forgive some<br>technique flaws, but it won't forgive the wrong brush”. Cheap brushes typically don't hold paint well. They apply it<br>unevenly, and shed bristles - unappealing traits for a topside paint or varnish brush. Expensive brushes are crafted<br>for optimum performance, but they are an investment and must be tended to properly to ensure a long, useful life.<br>Synthetic vs. Natural<br><br>Most natural bristles are made from hog bristle. They're often called China bristle because China is the<br>largest supplier of them. A good-quality China bristle is adequate for most finishing jobs. The next step up is ox<br>hair, which is often a mix of hog and ox, and the best finishing brushes are badger hair. These are ideal for<br>tipping-out polyurethane paints and final coats of varnish. With any of these types, there is a range of qualities<br>available, so be sure to examine a brush for quality before you purchase it.<br><br>Synthetic bristles are typically made of nylon or polyester and are less expensive than natural-bristle<br><br>brushes. Unfortunately they lack split bristle ends so they don't hold as much paint or lay it on as evenly as a good<br>natural bristle brush. While you can achieve good varnish results with a foam brush, you could never achieve<br>similar results with a synthetic bristle brush.<br>Brush Construction<br>Brush construction is as important as bristle choice when it comes to matching a brush with a job. Handcrafted<br>brushes with hand-chiseled tips and thick, split (also called flagged) bristles have more paint capacity than<br>flat-edged brushes, thus enabling longer strokes and more uniform paint or varnish transfer.<br><br>Handle shape and construction material is a matter of personal preference. I like the beefier,<br>beaver-tail-style handles because they fit in my hand well and have a nice weight balance between a tip loaded with<br>varnish and the handle. The down-side of having a larger beaver tail handle is that they are the hardest to fit in a<br>brush spinner for cleaning. I also like lightly finished wood handles, as they are easier to keep clean.<br><br>The brush bristles should be adhered with epoxy or vulcanized rubber inside the ferule. There should be no<br>noticeable gaps in the bristles, and if there's a plug inside the brush, it should be a thin one. The ferule should be<br>well fastened to the handle. A brush with a loose ferule and bristles head is useless for any detailed work.<br><br>Brush Shape<br><br>Rectangular heads are good for coating flat surfaces, or tipping-off after applying paint with a roller.<br>Brushes with oval cross-sections retain more paint and are good for finish coating varnish. Round brushes are good<br>for trim and cutting in. If you're going to invest in one or two quality brushes, an oval shaped brush or one that<br>closely resembles an oval shape should be on your list.<br><br>Matching the Brush with the Job<br><br>For varnishing: You need a brush that is dense, has a chisel tip, and absolutely will not shed bristles. This<br>could be a good badger hair brush or even a foam brush, although I prefer the badger hair. Don Casey extols the<br>good performance, easy cleanup, and environmental friendlier-ness of the Jen Poly-foam brushes. The cheap garden<br>variety foam brushes won’t hold up to the solvents in varnish and become too soft with prolonged use.<br><br>For painting: Foam brushes won't fly with polyurethane paints, plus you want the brush to hold plenty of<br>paint, so a bristle brush is better. Disposable chip brushes are adequate for small jobs or those where perfection isn't<br>a priority. If you're rolling-and-tipping a hull and will realistically follow a brush cleaning regimen, then an<br>oval-shaped badger hair or China bristle brush with a chiseled, fan-shaped tip is best. Never use your varnish brush<br>for painting or vice versa.<br><br></p>
