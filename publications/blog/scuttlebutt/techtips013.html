            <p>For the last three months I’ve been going over the boat getting it<br>ready for the epic voyages planned for this summer. In the<br>process I realized that I didn’t really have what you might call a<br>checklist for anything I was doing. Years of doing the same<br>chores year after year had made me complacent, and now that<br>I’m getting older (I use this as a comparative term only) I find<br>that my steel-trap memory has rusty springs. Not a good thing<br>when it could severely limit the scope of epic anything!<br><br>So where do you start? After giving it some thought I<br>decided that the checklist should follow the priority of necessity.<br>Given that reasoning, my sequence Of checklists was; boat hull,<br>spars and rigging, sails, engine, safety equipment and navigation<br>equipment. Starting with the boat hull was obvious, if the boat<br>doesn’t float you don’t have to worry about any of the rest of the<br>items.<br><br>Boat Hull<br><br>The hull checklist would depend on the boat but should look like<br>this:<br>a) Garboard drain plug installed<br>b) Hull caulking and seams in good shape (Your assessment here<br>will be confirmed or condemned when the boat is launched, so if<br>you are brave you can skip this check)<br>c) Sea cocks greased and closed<br>d) Double clamps on all connections below the waterline<br>e) Hose clamps not showing any rust .<br>f) Propeller shaft stuffing box packing adjusted (When was the<br>last time the packing was checked?)<br>g) Rudder post packing adjusted<br>h) Deck caulking in good condition especially over the berths!<br>T) Deck hardware bedded and well fastened<br><br>Spars and Rigging<br>The spars and rigging (with the sails of course) provide the<br>motive force for the boat so they come next. The things to check<br>should include:<br>a) Checks and splits in the spars should not have grown worse<br>over the winter, if they have they may need structural repair.<br>b) Check for loose or missing fittings, you know the ones that<br>were removed in the fall when you intended to refinish but never<br>got around to it. Try looking in the recycled peanut butter jar on<br>the back of the workbench, or the bottom of the tool bag. There<br>are several options. Be creative!<br>c) How about those frayed lines you noticed last year, time to<br>replace them?<br>d) And when was the last time you put on a heavy glove and<br>inspected the wire standing rigging for excessive wear or broken<br>strands in the form of “fish hooks”?<br>e) Check the blocks for free-running sheaves and excessive wear.<br>It might be time for a little maintenance.<br>f) Are the turnbuckle threads clean and well lubricated? Do you<br>have the correct cotter pins?<br><br>Sails<br>As for the sails the checks are fairly simple but time consuming<br>if you inspect the stitching at all the seams, which really<br>shouldn’t be necessary. What may be needed is to look for signs<br>of chafe in areas where lines rub across the stitching.<br>Engine<br>The engine checklist depends on your engine; gas and diesel will<br>have different checks so we’ll only cover the basics on this one.<br>They are; air, fuel, exhaust, oil, coolant, and zincs.<br>a) All engines have some form of intake screen or filter. It has to<br>be clean, and not restrict the airflow, especially for a diesel.<br>Check it.<br>b) If you topped off the fuel tank last fall like you should have,<br>you probably won’t have any issues with the fuel. If you didn’t<br>there is a possibility you have moisture or algae in the tank.<br>Make sure you have the appropriate clean fuel filters installed<br>and have at least one set of spares aboard. Now, do you know<br>how to change them?<br>c) Check the exhaust hoses for cracks or other deterioration.<br>d) Diesels have a bad habit of leaving serious carbon deposits in<br>the exhaust elbow if run at low RPM for extended periods of<br>time. This build-up causes a gradual loss of power over time<br>since the engine can’t expel exhaust gasses easily. When was the<br>last time you checked it?<br>e) Change the oil. Even if you changed it last fall.<br>f) Unless you are using an extended life anti-freeze you need to<br>change it. Anti-freeze contains several additives that provide<br>coolant pump lubrication, acid reducers, rust inhibitors and other<br>benefits to the engine that are depleted over time.<br>g) Most heat exchangers, both oil cooler and engine cooler, have<br>pencil zincs in the primary (salt-water) side. If they have been<br>reduced by more than half of their mass play it safe and replace<br>them. Save yourself a potentially costly heat exchanger replace-<br>ment or worse, engine replacement.<br>Safety Equipment<br>Now that we have checked the major items needed to keep the<br>boat afloat and make it go we need to do so safely. The key to<br>safety is preparation. All the things we’ve checked contribute to<br>safety but there are several pieces of safety equipment needed to<br>ensure you can handle an emergency. Your safety equipment<br>checklist should include:<br>a) Class I or II life jackets for the number of people you plan on<br>having aboard.<br>b) A working VHF radio and the know-how to broadcast a<br>“MAYDAY”<br>c) Fire extinguishers capable of fighting class A (wood, cloth,<br>etc.), B (fuels, oil), and C (electrical) fires.<br>d) A good bilge pump and perhaps a good bucket too. (Buckets<br>rarely fail or clog. A scared person with a bucket can move a lot<br>of water!).<br>e) An anchor.<br><br>Most folks don’t view navigation equipment as “Safety” gear,<br>but if you do find yourself in a bad situation, rescue will be a lot<br>more effective if the responder knows where you are. GPS and<br>Loran are good tools. They can give you a good position in a<br>reasonably short time. Battery powered GPS should be part of<br>your emergency kit.<br><br>See you safely on the water!<br></p>
