            <p>Tech Tips: It’s Not Too Late<br>(But Getting There Quickly)<br>OK. It’s winter already! The boat is put away and you have done everything to get it ready for a freezing<br>winter ashore. Or have you? With the rapid onset of bad weather this year is it possible that something was<br><br>forgotten? Here’s a checklist.<br>General stuff (should be obvious):<br><br>. Take the sails off, fold and bag them and store in a nice warm basement, get them washed if needed.<br><br>. Strip the running gear, standing rig and spars.<br><br>. Remove the anchor and rode so that you can clean out all the Maine mud in the chain locker.<br><br>. Drain the tanks and flush the hoses of all the fluids. Then pour in some marine/RV safe anti-freeze to<br>displace any fluids trapped in low sections of the hoses.<br><br>. Remove all the food and other stuff that bugs and mice like to eat when you’re not there.<br><br>. Take all the shoes, clothes, blankets, pillows and other things that will hold moisture and possibly mildew<br><br>over the winter, home for a good washing.<br><br>Normal stuff (but not so obvious):<br><br>. Change the engine oil. Don’t leave acids that are a product of combustion in your engine.<br><br>. Add fuel stabilizer to the fuel to cut down moisture absorption and prevent corrosion.<br><br>. Top off the fuel tank(s) to minimize the moisture that gets into the tank during temperature swings.<br><br>. Check the engine anti-freeze. It doesn’t last forever. If more than 5 years old it could be creating corrosion<br>problems for your cooling system.<br><br>. Shut down the engine while spraying fogging oil into the intake.<br><br>. Drain the salt water side of the engine’s cooling system.<br><br>. Pull the impeller from the raw water pump. Lightly lubricate the interior of the pump.<br><br>. Drain the salt water side of the heat exchanger. Check the zinc.<br><br>. After the boat is out of the water open all the thru hull valves so that any water trapped inside the valve can<br>drain out. Freezing water inside the valve can ruin it.<br><br>. Drain the salt water out of the muffler if you use a water lift-type muffler as most of us do.<br><br>. Put a rag or ball into the outboard end of the exhaust pipe. Stick a rag or ball into the air intake. This greatly<br>reduces the amount of moisture that gets into the engine.<br><br>. Pour some marine/RV anti-freeze into the deck drains or any other place where water may accumulate and<br><br>freeze.<br></p>
