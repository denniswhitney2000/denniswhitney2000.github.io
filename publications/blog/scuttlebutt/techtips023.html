            <p>Tech Tips:<br><br>Choosing a Cleaning Product<br>Submitted by Bill Whitney, from Practical-sailor.com<br><br>When choosing a multi-purpose cleaning product, it's a<br>good idea to look for one where the pH level is balanced so that it<br>is an effective cleaner, but isn't so strong that it will harm the<br>surface being cleaned. This is especially important if the surface<br>has a sealant or wax coating.<br><br>The pH scale runs from zero to 14. The mid-point of the<br>range, 7, is considered neutral; pure water is a neutral liquid.<br>Liquids that have a pH higher than 7 are considered to be basic,<br>or alkaline. Most hand soaps and bleach are alkaline cleaners.<br>Basic or alkaline cleaners do well at removing oils and fats, so if<br>you're looking to degrease your engine, try a cleaner with a higher<br>pH.<br><br>Solutions with pH levels measuring zero to 7 are consid-<br>ered acidic; coffee, sodas, and lemon juice are examples. Acids<br>break down difficult stains, making them easier to remove. So, if<br>you're looking to get some rust off your deck or scrub away a<br>waterline stain, a cleaner with a lower pH will do a better job than<br>one with a high pH. Anytime you use an acidic cleaner, however,<br>be sure to rinse the area being cleaned with fresh water afterward.<br></p>
