            <p>Tech Tips: Checking a Marine<br><br>Alternator or Generator Output<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>Whether your Friendship is a Class ‘A’ or a newer<br>sloop, chances are good that it has been modernized with some<br>form of mechanical propulsion to complement her sails. This<br>could take several forms. From the 1920’s through 50’s it was<br>usually a gasoline engine, but as technology developed after<br>WWII these power plants started shifting to diesel, providing a<br>better safety margin, and as time progressed, less weight. Today<br>we are seeing advances in battery and battery charging technol-<br>ogy which have introduced electric propulsion.<br><br>We have become used to having this “iron wind”<br>capability to get us where we want to go when the wind quits or<br>shifts contrary to our destination. We also have become used to<br>having the electrical energy from the battery or battery banks.<br>How much energy the battery banks hold is dependent on how<br>many batteries there are, their condition, how well engineered<br>the installation is, and how well fed they are by the generator or<br>alternator driven by the boat’s propulsion plant. In other words,<br>how big is “the tank”, how well is it connected, and what equip-<br>ment do you have to keep it full. Since the first two elements of<br>the equation are governed by the builder of the boat, and to a<br>degree by the maintenance it receives, this article will only focus<br>on the alternators, generators and their regulators that keep “the<br>tank” full.<br><br>Early gasoline and diesel engines were equipped with<br>generators. Starting in the early 60’s, these engines were<br>equipped with alternators. What’s the difference? The differ-<br>ence is both mechanical and electrical and, to explain<br>sufficiently, beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say<br>that generators produce direct current (DC) using mechanical<br>switches, and alternators create alternating current (AC) and use<br>big diodes (electric switches) to convert it into DC. Alternators<br>are far more efficient and reliable than generators, and have<br>universally replaced generators in this application.<br><br>No matter which you have, generator or alternator, the<br>key is how much energy it puts back into your batteries. A key<br>component to this is the regulator that controls the device’s<br>output. If you own a voltmeter it is fairly easy to check the<br>health of the components in the system that’s keeping the batter-<br>ies fully charged. Before you begin testing the system you have<br>to make sure the battery or batteries are in good shape and are at<br>least 75% charged. A standard lead-acid battery at rest, that has<br>not been charged or used for 12-24 hours, should read 12.4 volts<br>or higher at the battery terminals. If it is less than 12.0 volts, the<br>battery has a problem and should be replaced. Be sure that the<br>measurement is made directly on the battery posts. If you take<br>the measurement through any of the cabling, a drop in voltage<br>may be caused by a corroded cable connection.<br><br>The next step is to check the belt for proper tension. A<br>loose belt will slip on the pulleys and fail to turn the rotor at the<br>correct speed, especially when putting out a high current while<br>recharging the batteries. Be sure to check the belt for wear,<br>cracks or dryness. Worn or damaged belts should be replaced. A<br>rule-of-thumb for belt tension is that the belt should not deflect<br>more than 1 inch on its longest dimension. If it’s too tight it will<br>stress the bearings of devices driven by the belt.<br>Now it is time to start the engine and bring it up to a<br>high idle of 800-1000 RPM. Now check the voltage at the<br>battery again. After 2-3 minutes it should be between 13.6 and<br>14.2 volts. If it is less than that, measure the voltage at the<br>output of the generator or alternator. This is done by putting the<br>voltmeter’s positive (red) lead on the terminal where the big<br>cable is attached and the negative (black) lead on the engine<br>block. If this reading is less than 13.8 volts the generator or<br>alternator is defective. If it is more than 14.8 volts then there is a<br>problem with the regulator connections, the regulator itself, the<br>cables going to the batteries, or the battery switch. In no case<br>should it be over 15.0 volts. In this case you need to clean up all<br>the connections or replace any questionable cables. Remember<br>that you need to check both the positive and negative cable<br>connections. On at least one occasion I’ve observed that the<br>only problem was a questionable ground connection between the<br>generator/alternator and the engine block.<br><br>Note that most alternators have the regulator inside the<br>alternator case where you can’t see it. Some custom installations<br>have an external “smart” regulator, which controls the alternator<br>output. In either case the voltages shown above will tell you if<br>things are working correctly or not.<br></p>
