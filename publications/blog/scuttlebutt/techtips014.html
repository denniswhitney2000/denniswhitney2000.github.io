            <p>Tech Tips #14 - Jack Stands<br><br>by Bill Whitney<br><br>Have you ever been doing something, something that<br>you have been doing for years, something that's so common that<br>you never thought much about it? Putting the boat up for the<br>winter is sort of like that for me. After 30 or 40 years of boat<br>ownership, everything is almost automatic. There will be excep-<br>tions now and then, depending on the changes that were made<br>over the season, but nothing that alters the basic process. Empty<br>the boat, fog the engine, top up the fuel, haul her, set up the<br>blocks and stands, and toss on the cover. What could be simpler?<br><br>But I'm cursed! Nothing is ever simple! I always get<br>myself in trouble by wanting to know too much. Don't ask me<br>why I started thinking about blocking and boat stands. The boat<br>has not fallen over, ever! Since the yard always hauls the boat<br>and sets her up on the blocks and places the stands along her<br>sides I never get directly involved. Nevertheless, for some<br>strange compulsive reason I wanted to know what the specifica-<br>tions on boat stands were. So armed with this almost obsessive<br>engineer's curiosity I hit the internet for some answers.<br><br>The internet is a great resource and manufacturers are<br>more than willing to share information on their products.<br>Distributors, such as West Marine, Jamestown Distributors and<br>others have great links to their suppliers that are loaded with data<br>and general information. Brownell is no exception. They have a<br>great "Boat Stand Selection Guide" that gives you all the infor-<br>mation you need for setting up your Friendship Sloop, lobster<br>boat or trawler safely and securely.<br><br>One thing that did jump out at me was the recommenda-<br>tion to place the stands approximately 8’ apart. The yard usually<br>places them at twice that spacing. I don't think it has anything to<br>do with the bulkhead spacing, since that's where they are usually<br>placed but I need to speak to the foreman just to be sure! Below<br>are several paragraphs that are directly from the selection guide.<br><br>"The correct type of boat stand (sailboat vs. motorboat)<br>is determined by the angle between the hull and the stands center<br>pipe. The threaded rod from the top that enters the stand’s center<br>pipe should do so at approximately a 90 degree angle to the<br>boat’s hull. For example, a motor boat with a deep vee bow<br>would use a pair of sailboat stands at the bow, with motor boat<br>stands at the stern.<br><br>To determine the proper Brownell Boat Stands to use,<br>you must realize the boat stands are to stabilize your boat and the<br>keel blocking supports the boat’s weight. A simple method<br>would be to take the draft in inches, add the height of the block-<br>ing, and subtract about six inches. Base your decision on keeping<br>a minimum amount of thread exposed on the top.<br><br>A minimum of four boat stands should be used with<br>powerboats and a minimum of five boat stands should be used<br>with sailboats. One exception: a full keel sailboat may not<br>require a bow stand. Use a pair of boat stands, one placed port<br>and one placed starboard, for approximately each 8 feet of the<br>boat's length. If you are going to be stored in an extremely windy<br>area or leaving a sailboat mast stepped, extra boat stands should<br>be used in addition to our minimum requirements."<br><br>If you, or the yard where you store the boat, are not<br>conforming to these recommendations perhaps you need to think<br>about what your insurance company may say if (God forbid)<br>there is an accident. In retrospect, I'm glad my curiosity lead me<br>to the Brownell site. This old dog learned a new trick.<br></p>
