            <p>Tech Tips<br>Space Weather and Marine<br><br>Navigation<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>All sailors are aware of the weather and its impact on<br>their comfort and safety. Terrestrial weather imposes limits on<br>most of our nautical pursuits, and can, at its worst, pose a real<br>threat to our lives and property. However when studied by<br>knowledgeable meteorologists, its impact can be forecast and<br>action taken to mitigate whatever it may bring our way.<br><br>We live in the lower level of the atmosphere called the<br>troposphere. Tropospheric weather is the weather that we can<br>watch develop. It’s up close and personal. It affects what we<br>wear, where we go, and our heating bill; even what we eat.<br>However, there is another aspect of the weather that we give very<br>little thought to, that is more important to our lives than we<br>realize. As you probably guessed from the title above, I’m refer-<br>ring to space weather, the cumulative sum of storms, calms and<br>other disturbances that occur on the sun and in the ionospheric<br>layers of the atmosphere above us, and which can impact our<br>electronic systems.<br><br>Ionosphere<br><br>The Ionosphere is part of Earth’s upper atmosphere,<br>between approximately 50 and 400 miles above us, where<br>extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation from the sun<br>ionize the atoms and molecules in the high altitude gasses, creat-<br>ing an ion-rich layer of the atmosphere. The ionosphere is impor-<br>tant because it reflects and modifies radio waves used for commu-<br>nication and navigation.<br><br>The atmospheric atoms and molecules are impacted by<br>the high energy the EUV and X-ray photons deliver from the sun.<br>The amount of energy (photon flux) at EUV and X-ray<br>wavelengths varies by nearly a factor of ten over the 11 year solar<br>cycle. The density of the ionosphere changes accordingly. Other<br>solar phenomena, such as solar flares (sunspots), changes in the<br>solar wind, and geomagnetic storms also effect the charging of<br>the ionosphere. Since the largest amount of ionization is caused<br>by solar radiation, the night-side of the earth, and the pole pointed<br>away from the sun (depending on the season) have much less<br>ionization than the day-side of the earth, and the pole pointing<br>towards the sun.<br><br>This means that as the sun’s activity changes, so does<br>our ionosphere, and with these changes the performance of our<br>electronic devices, which carry electronic data through the<br>ionosphere, will change.<br><br>Space Weather and GPS Systems<br><br>The use of satellite radio navigation systems, like the<br>Global Positioning System (GPS), has grown dramatically in the<br>last decade. GPS receivers are now in nearly every cell phone<br>and in many automobiles, boats, trucks, and any equipment that<br>moves and needs precision location measurements.<br><br>There are several ways in which space weather impacts<br>GPS function. GPS radio signals travel from the satellite to the<br>receiver on the ground, passing through the Earth’s ionosphere.<br>The charged plasma of the ionosphere bends the path of the GPS<br>radio signal similar to the way a lens bends the path of light. In<br>the absence of space weather, GPS systems compensate for the<br><br>“average” or “quiet” ionosphere, using a model to calculate its<br>effect on the accuracy of the positioning information. But when<br>the ionosphere is disturbed by a space weather event, the models<br>are no longer accurate and the receivers are unable to calculate an<br>accurate position based on the satellites overhead.<br><br>In calm conditions, GPS systems can provide position<br>information with an accuracy of 3 feet or less. During a severe<br>space weather storm, these errors can increase to 100 yards or<br>more.<br><br>Since radio waves are affected by the presence of<br>electrons, the more electrons in the path of the wave, the more the<br>radio signal will be affected. The change in the path and velocity<br>of radio waves in the ionosphere has a big impact on the accuracy<br>of satellite navigation systems.<br><br>A geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance of Earth's<br>magnetosphere that occurs when there is a very efficient exchange<br>of energy from the solar wind into the space environment<br>surrounding Earth. Geomagnetic storms create large disturbances<br>in the ionosphere. The currents and energy introduced by the<br>storm enhance the ionosphere and increase the total number of<br>ionospheric electrons. GPS systems cannot correctly model this<br>dynamic enhancement and errors are introduced into the position<br>calculations. This usually occurs at high latitudes, though major<br>storms can produce enhancements in the ionosphere large enough<br>to impact mid-latitudes.<br><br>During storms, the currents in the ionosphere, and the<br>energetic particles that precipitate into the ionosphere add energy<br>in the form of heat that can increase the density and distribution<br>of density in the upper atmosphere, causing extra drag on satel-<br>lites in low-earth orbit. The local heating also creates strong<br>horizontal variations in the ionospheric density that can modify<br>the path of radio signals and create errors in the positioning infor-<br>mation provided by GPS. While the storms can create beautiful<br>aurora, they can also disrupt navigation systems and create<br>harmful geomagnetic-induced currents in the power grid and<br>pipelines.<br><br>Smaller scale electric field fluctuations that may cause<br>GPS signal to waiver are called ionospheric scintillations, and are<br>not associated with space weather storms, but are simply part of<br>the natural day-night cycle of the equatorial ionosphere. Severe<br>scintillation conditions can prevent a GPS receiver from locking<br>on to the signal and can make it impossible to calculate a<br>position. Less severe scintillation conditions can reduce the<br>accuracy and the confidence of positioning results. Scintillation<br>is more prevalent at low and high latitudes; mid-latitudes, such as<br>the United States, experience scintillation much less frequently.<br>Scintillation is a strong function of local time, season, geomag-<br>netic activity, and solar cycle.<br><br>The lesson here is that under “normal” atmospheric and<br>solar conditions that have been studied and modeled for years,<br>our electronic aids to navigation, such as GPS, will work reliably<br>and with acceptable accuracy. Unfortunately, the sun is not<br>always “normal”. Solar events have a significant impact on our<br>ionosphere that can and do put it outside the normal parameters<br>that in many cases cannot be corrected for. Most of these abnor-<br>mal events are not effectively communicated to the user commu-<br>nities. If you put blind faith in what your GPS or GPS integrated<br>chart plotter is telling you, you need to reassess your navigation<br>practices, or at least increase your insurance coverage!<br></p>
