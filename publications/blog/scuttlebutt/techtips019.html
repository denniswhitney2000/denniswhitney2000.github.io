            <p>Tech Tips #19 - Cruising Lessons<br>By Bill Whitney<br><br>I don’t have my logs or a chart in front of me as I write<br>this, but based on previous years’ logs the Buzzards Bay Fleet<br>averages almost 400 nautical miles each year on our round trip<br>excursion from Cape Cod, MA to the shores of Rockland, ME<br>and beyond. We don’t claim to be expert cruisers, but we are<br>getting pretty darn good at it and we have a lot of fun along the<br>way. Over the years we have coped with anchor, engine, electrical<br>and bilge pump problems, and the full range of navigation,<br>accommodation, and even restaurant reservation issues. We dealt<br>with the difficulties, learned from them, had a wonderful time in<br>the process, and importantly, we did it in the company of fellow<br>cruisers. It’s sort of like bringing your own maritime support<br>group with you. As the saying goes, there’s safety in number<br><br>Based on our experience I would like to offer something<br>of a challenge: join us!! Better still, get your own local fleet<br>together and become cruisers. It will make you better sailors. This<br>excerpt from “How to Sail Around the World’ by Hal Roth,<br>reaches a little beyond what I’m advocating but it makes an<br>important point.<br><br>“Cruising under sail is a hundredfold more complex<br>than merely buying a suitable yacht. We know this because the<br>marinas and harbors of the world are dotted with private pleas-<br>ure craft, most of which go nowhere at all. There are tens of<br>thousands of boat owners but very few sailors. Pay attention to<br>this phrase: lots of boat owners but very few sailors. And a sailor<br>you must be if you're going to try ocean voyaging. You need a<br>modicum of sailing aptitude, some ability to fix things, and the<br>willingness to pitch in and work.<br><br>Most veteran long-distance small-boat sailors are free<br>spirits who fall into the classification of restless adventurer and<br>who are always looking at distant horizons and trying new<br>things. These spooky engineers usually lack fancy certificates,<br>but they've all served fairly intensive apprenticeships and have<br>learned a good bit about the sea, the care of their vessels, and<br>the management of themselves.<br><br>To learn the fundamentals of sailing, you need to go toa<br>special school for a few weeks. You will be taken out in a dinghy<br>or small vessel for instruction in sail handling, tacking, gybing,<br>docking, maneuvering in restricted waters, and following safety<br>procedures. Then you must practice as often as possible and<br>serve as crew for friends on their yachts.<br><br>In the beginning, you will only be a grunt, but little by<br>little it will come to you. Every time you sail on a different vessel,<br>you learn a thing or two because each captain has his own way<br>of doing things. You need to find out about anchors and rigging,<br>and to get some notion of sanding and painting and fixing things<br>because life under sail is a never-ending round of maintenance,<br>modifications, and large and small repairs.”<br><br>Now, if you grew up in and around boats, you won’t<br>need a special school to teach you the rudiments of sailing, but<br>regardless of your level of formal training, the best way to<br>advance any of your skills is to use them. Add the safety and fun<br>factor of sailing in a small fleet of friends in Friendship sloops,<br>and you have the best learning environment imaginable. So find a<br>like-minded soul or two, and come join us or plan your own<br>cruise. See you on the water!<br><br></p>
