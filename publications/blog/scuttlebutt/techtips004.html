            <p>Tech Tips #4<br>written by “The Old Salt”<br><br>Well here we are again. Hope you all had a great, trouble free summer. We certainly did. Needed a few more patches on the<br>mains'l but on the whole the annual cruise to the great State of Maine was extremely enjoyable. A major contributor to that enjoy-<br>ment was the fact that nothing went seriously wrong, at least not for us, as long as you don't include finishing dead last at Rockland<br>a real scrious matter. I was hoping to gather more material for this column by listening to folks talk about their mechanical or<br>electrical problems. But other than a battery failure (on my boat) and an engine that wouldn't start on another boat, things were<br>pretty uneventful. Since I couldn't use anyone else's misfortune as a source for an article I guess we'll stick to the original plan. I<br>was hoping that someone would ask a few specific questions that I could address. Hopefully, this column will be a forum for sharing<br>the vast range of practical experience accumulated by our membership and not just my favorite topics. It is intended to be the place<br>where you, the reader, can submit technical questions and either obtain answers or direction to appropriate reference material.<br><br>Since you have not asked for specifics I'll continue on course with the original list of topics. In case you don't remember, the topics<br>are: electrical wiring, alternators and regulators, batteries, grounding and bonding, radios and antennas, and instrumentation (depth.<br>speed, GPS, LORAN, etc.). We already did wiring and alternators, so let's look at regulators.<br><br>In the last article we looked at alternators and getting them operating in the correct speed range by sizing the pulley appropriately.<br>Now that we are producing all that electrical power, how do you control it? And what are we really trying to control?<br><br>To understand things a little better let's look at a simple system like the one in your car. It is comprised of one engine, one alterna-<br>tor. one battery, the starter motor, lights, radios, power seats, cell phones, etc. that collectively we can call the "load" on the clectri-<br>cal system. In a simple system like this the alternator has an electronic regulator built into it that senses the output voltage of the<br>alternator. Because the battery and the devices that constitute the load are connected directly to the alternator, whatever the alterna-<br>tor output voltage is, is the voltage across the battery and load. The regulator will try to maintain the voltage at approximately 14<br>volts by increasing or decreasing the current being produced by the alternator. :<br><br>Afier you start the car, the voltage across the battery drops because you partially discharged it while turning the starter motor. In<br>response to the drop in voltage the regulator increases the current through the rotor windings in the alternator. This in turn<br>increases the intensity of the magnetic field of the rotor. As the engine starts to turn so does the alternator's rotor because the pulley<br>drives it via the V-belt to the engine's crankshaft. The spinning magnetic field induces a current in the stator windings that are built<br>into the outside housing of the alternator. This current "alternates" between a positive going and negative going current, hence the<br>name "alternator". The alternating current is then fed through six large diodes where it is rectified, or changed, into a direct current<br>that then recharges the battery. As the battery recharges its voltage increases, and sensing this, the regulator decreases the current<br>going to the rotor. Decreasing the rotor current decreases the alternator's output. So by controlling the rotor current we control the<br>output current of the alternator and the overall electrical system voltage.<br><br>The regulators built into automotive alternators, and those designed for simple marine systems are quite sophisticated. They<br>recharge the battery at the proper rate, compensate for temperature changes, and regulate the current supplied to all the electrical<br>accessories of a car or boat. But this sophistication also has its disadvantages. If you add a second battery, a battery switch, or larger<br>load you have changed the electrical system design and the regulator built into the alternator may not be able to measure up. A<br>boat's electrical system is usually much larger than that of an automobile, unless you have a really, really big car. As you add more<br>wire, more of a load, the losses can start to add up. The primary problem is that the regulator is built into the alternator. As you add<br>different components to the electrical system you need to sense the system voltage from a point closer to the battery or ideally at the<br>battery itself.<br><br>In order to accomplish this you have to have an external regulator, and an alternator that will accept it. Many of the alternators<br>that are supplied to the marine industry have external regulators mounted on the back of the alternator case. Motorola, Lucas and<br>Delco are among the supplicrs. Normally the voltage sensing wire is attached to the ignition switch, which is usually wired to the<br>starting battery. If your system is one of these, make sure that the wire is large enough and the connections are clean. There are also<br>a number of after-market regulators that are designed specifically for recharging deep-cycle batteries. The beauty of using a modern,<br>stand-alone, regulator is that they will do a much better job of maintaining your batteries and prolonging their life.<br><br>I think they're a good investment. Remember that battery failure I mentioned earlier? This was one of the original batteries I<br>bought for the boat fifteen years ago. And I still have its mate that I bought with it in the battery box. I don't get that kind of life out<br>of my car batteries.<br><br>The advantage of these new regulators is the way they control recharging. Rather than following a simple recharge curve, they<br>follow a three-step sequence that more closely matches the electrochemical needs of the battery. The steps are: bulk, absorption and<br>float. In the bulk step the regulator provides a recharge current of 30-40% of the batteries amp-hour capacity until the battery voltage<br>reaches about 14.4 Volts. After that it switches to the absorption step. In this mode the regulator tapers off the charging current<br>while holding the voltage at 14.4 Volts. When the current drops to less than 5% of the amp-hour capacity the regulator switches<br>again. In the float mode the output voltage of the alternator is regulated at 13.5 Volts, where it will stay until a discharged condition<br>(WC URUBUCE IPOME Fase 0)<br>is sensed.<br><br>Another nice feature that many of these regulators have is<br>that they are adjustable. But I don't recommend messing with<br>the adjustments unless you have a good 4-digit digital multime-<br>ter. The factory settings are quite good for all but the most<br>sophisticated electrical systems. If you really think it needs to<br>be tweaked, a good marine electrician should be able to hook<br>things up and adjust it in a few hours, depending of course on<br>the condition of the system when the work starts.<br><br>Balmar, Heart Interface and Aqualine are three of the<br>manufacturers of "smart" regulators. Most of the marine<br>catalogs list various makes of alternators and regulators. If you<br>decide to spend the dollars for an upgraded system I recom-<br>mend that you purchase a regulator that matches the alternator.<br>The hook-up will be much more straightforward. Good luck.<br><br></p>
