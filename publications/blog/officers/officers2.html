            <p>Dear Friendship Sloop Society Member,</p>
            <p>The fall season is now upon us, the sloops are being hauled and stored for the winter, and we are reflecting on the past year of the Friendship Sloop Society. It is time to make plans to attend the FSS 2024 Annual Meeting on November 23rd in South Portland, Maine. Come join your fellow sloop lovers to talk about the past year, plan next year's events and discuss the Sloop Society's outlook for the future. There will be chandlery items to purchase, auction items to bid on (please consider donating an item to the auction) and food and drinks to enjoy. There will be business to decide, people to meet and greet, and celebration of Homecoming events at Southwest Harbor and Rockland.</p>
            <p>This year we will have a guest speaker. Dave Gogel, executive director of Rockland Main Street, will be at the meeting to present plans for next year's second annual Rockland Maritime Heritage Days.</p>
            <p>Enclosed you will find the annual meeting notice along with the schedule for the day and the remittance form. Also included is your membership renewal form. Please note that there is an increase in our dues. At last year's annual meeting it was voted by the membership to increase the dues by $5. Please renew your support of the FSS and continue to be a member of the organization that honors the heritage of the traditional Friendship Sloop.</p>
            <p>The Friendship Sloop Society is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Your membership dues and donations to the FSS are now tax deductible to the full extent of the law.</p>
            <p>Along with your renewal of membership please consider gift memberships. As the holidays draw near or as special occasions occur in your family (birthdays, anniversaries) an FSS membership for an interested person or crew member would benefit the Sloop Society as well as the new member who will be receiving newsletters, yearbook, invitations and updates on Sloop Society news.</p>
            <p>Thank you in advance for your continuing support of the Friendship Sloop Society with your payment of dues for 2025. I hope to see you at the annual meeting or at an upcoming Sloop Society event. Your participation is important to the future of the Society. If you have questions about the Society's activities or suggestions about our events please contact one of the officers and share your ideas.</p>
            <p>
